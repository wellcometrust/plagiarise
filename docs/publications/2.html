    <li id=2081 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The great importance of the organs of generation, and their preservation in a state of health and vigor have been admitted by the concurrent testimony of ancient and modern writers; in fact, the due and proper performance of the special functions with which they are charged has ever been considered essentially necessary to the health and well-being of the economy, both physical and mental.
      (31.7%)

    </li>
    <li id=2082 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      They are parts of admirable construction, form, and use, and constitute a striking evidence of the wonderful skill and contrivance in the adaptation of a special mechanism in the system for the performance of one of its most important and essential functions,—that of the propagation of the species.
      (41.1%)

    </li>
    <li id=2083 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Unequalled in the delicacy of their texture, and the comparative minuteness of their structure, their peculiar fitness for the functions assigned them in the economy, when they are in a state of perfect integrity, excites the astonishment and admiration, alike of the anatomist and the philosopher.
      (16.1%)

    </li>
    <li id=2084 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Their very complexity, while it renders them liable to many disorders by any of which their utility may be impaired, is wisely rendered subservient to the important purpose of separating and purifying the vivifying fluid.
      (11.2%)

    </li>
    <li id=2085 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Like that complex and delicate piece of machinery, a watch, constructed by human skill, the organs of generation in man,—a still more complex and more delicate apparatus, created by the Divine will, are liable to derangement and impairment of function and structure from many causes, the nature and effects of which will be investigated in the following pages.
      (17.1%)

    </li>
    <li id=2086 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      In order however that these may be fully and clearly understood, it will, we think, be advisable to preface the observations we propose hereafter to offer respecting them by some notice of the anatomical arrangement and physiological action of the organs which are immediately subservient to the function of generation, and also of those which are only indirectly connected therewith.
      (17.3%)

    </li>
    <li id=2087 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The parts in man which are immediately connected with the function just alluded to, are, as has been already stated, of a complex nature and very delicate structure.
      (10.7%)

    </li>
    <li id=2088 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      They consist of the testicles, by which the semen or seed is secreted, and of their appendages, through which the seminal fluid is transmitted to the urethra at its origin near the neck of the bladder, and of the penis or yard, by means of which the act of copulation takes place, and through a canal in the under part of which, called the urethra, the seed is conveyed from the receptacles in which it is retained, to those organs in the female, which are engaged in the function of generation.
      (33.4%)

    </li>
    <li id=2089 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The urinary organs, both in the male and female, may be regarded as subsidiary to this function, and many of the diseases to which they are liable exert a malificent influence on its performance, and not unfrequently produce impotence, either temporary or permanent, according to the nature and severity of the disease.
      (16.0%)

    </li>
    <li id=2090 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The kidneys, which are the organs solely engaged in the secretion of the urine, are glandular bodies of an oblong shape, seated on either side of the spine, upon and below the two last ribs, and behind the stomach and intestines; the right kidney is also under the liver, when the man is in the erect position, and the left under the spleen: the right kidney is generally the lower and the larger.
      (34.4%)

    </li>
    <li id=2091 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      It is said that these organs are more considerable in size in those persons, whose passions are very strong, and almost uncontrollable, than they are in those who are less addicted to women.
      (29.5%)

    </li>
    <li id=2092 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      In shape the kidney resembles the kidney-bean; its structure is almost wholly made up of arteries and veins, with a few small branches of nerves, derived partly from those which are connected with the ribs, and thence called intercostal, and partly from a branch from the stomach, thus causing a great sympathy between those organs.
      (20.1%)

    </li>
    <li id=2093 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The arteries by which the kidneys are supplied with blood, which is partly used for the support of the organ, and partly for the secretion of urine, is derived directly from the aorta, or great artery of the body.
      (16.7%)

    </li>
    <li id=2094 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      When it enters the kidney, which it does about its middle, it divides into branches, which again are divided into smaller ones, and these into still smaller, until they terminate in vessels so exceedingly minute as to be invisible to the naked eye.
      (15.9%)

    </li>
    <li id=2095 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      From these the veins are formed, and by these the urine is secreted, and falls by drops into a pouch which is situated about the middle or lower part of the organ, and which forms the commencement of the ureter.
      (14.3%)

    </li>
    <li id=2096 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The vein joins the great cava vein, and discharges its blood into what is called by anatomists the great portal system, by which it is conveyed to the liver, after it has been freed in the kidney from a certain portion of its serum, and also from certain salts.
      (22.2%)

    </li>
    <li id=2097 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The nerves of the kidneys are few and small, so that the organ is not endowed with much sensation.
      (7.4%)

    </li>
    <li id=2098 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The ureters are long, hollow tubes, and constitute the continuation of the pelves of the kidneys.
      (13.6%)

    </li>
    <li id=2099 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      There is one on each side of the body, and they pass downwards, and slightly inwards to the back and lower part of the bladder, which they pierce, running between its coats for about an inch, so that if the bladder should become exceedingly distended, its contents would not be forced back into these tubes.
      (17.5%)

    </li>
    <li id=2100 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      They are well supplied with branches of arteries, veins, and nerves, and their sensibility in a state of disease is considerable.
      (14.6%)

    </li>
    <li id=2101 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Their use is to convey the urine from the kidney into the bladder.
      (11.1%)

    </li>
    <li id=2102 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The bladder is situated in the part of the body called the pelvis.

    <li id=2103 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      It is of considerable size, and admits in some instances of distension to a degree that would hardly be credited, were it not a well-known fact.
      (10.7%)

    </li>
    <li id=2104 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      This power however is not acquired without considerable risk to health and life.
      (7.4%)

    </li>
    <li id=2105 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      This organ in man lies directly on the bowel, but in women the womb intervenes between it and the rectum.
      (10.2%)

    </li>
    <li id=2106 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      It is of an oval shape, constitutes the great receptacle of the urine, which, when it has collected to such an amount as to become a source of inconvenience, is by a voluntary effort, got rid of through the urethra,— a prolongation of the bladder, commencing at its neck, and extending along the under surface of the penis, as has been already stated.
      (19.8%)

    </li>
    <li id=2107 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The bladder is well supplied with arteries, veins, and nerves, and is very sensitive when in a state of disease.
      (12.7%)

    </li>
    <li id=2108 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      It has three coats, one of them being composed of muscular fibres; its constriction causes the expulsion of the urine: it has on that account been called the detrusor urince.
      (26.4%)

    </li>
    <li id=2109 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The neck of the bladder, which in man is longer and narrower, and in woman is shorter and wider, is surrounded by a sphincter muscle, by which the continual running away of the urine is prevented, unless from disease the muscle has become useless.
      (30.9%)

    </li>
    <li id=2110 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The secretion or separation of the urine from the blood by vessels appropriated for that purpose, constitutes the principal functions of the kidneys.
      (15.2%)

    </li>
    <li id=2111 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The fluid, when secreted is carried along the ureters into the bladder,—the great receptacle in which it is retained until from its state of distension, its evacuation by the urethra is required.
      (13.5%)

    </li>
    <li id=2112 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The process by which the secretion of urine is effected is one of exceeding interest, and admirably adapted to display the wisdom of the Divine machinist.
      (8.5%)

    </li>
    <li id=2113 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The blood from which it is to be separated, is conveyed to the organ, as has been already mentioned, by the renal artery, which divides into branches supplying different parts of the organ, and these again in their turn form arches of communication with each other, whence spring minute arteries or branchlets, these again constituting a complete network of vessels by a general inosculation.
      (16.4%)

    </li>
    <li id=2114 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      They terminate in the commencement of veins, and also in uriniferous tubes, by which latter the separation of the urine is effected.
      (10.3%)

    </li>
    <li id=2115 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The crypts or cryptce, small round or oval bodies, which are found everywhere in the network of vessels just spoken of, and which consist almost solely of vessels, are by some supposed to be the origin of the uriniferous tubes.
      (12.2%)

    </li>
    <li id=2116 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The tubes terminate in a mammillar process, which projects into a small membranous bag, called from its shape the infundibulum or funnel; into this bag the urine passes from the uriniferous tubes, it is thence conveyed to the larger pouch called the pelvis, and afterwards through the ureter into the bladder.
      (21.5%)

    </li>
    <li id=2117 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Several of the tubes terminate in one mammillar process, and so also several of the mammillar processes open into one infundibulum.
      (7.2%)

    </li>
    <li id=2118 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The last-named pouch, like the pelvis of the kidney, the ureters, bladder, and urethra, is defended from the acrimony of the urine by a secretion of mucus which lines and sheaths its inner coat.
      (12.7%)

    </li>
    <li id=2119 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The quantity of urine, and the celerity with which it is passed after certain fluids have been taken into the stomach, have induced in some persons a belief that vessels existed, but which have not yet been discovered, forming an immediate communication between the stomach and the bladder, unconnected with the kidneys.
      (16.1%)

    </li>
    <li id=2120 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      But the quickness with which fluids can be absorbed and conveyed to the thoracic ducts, the velocity of the circulation, and the great quantity of blood carried by the renal arteries to the kidneys, will account for the celerity with which urine is separated, without having recourse to the supposition of unknown channels.
      (20.0%)

    </li>
    <li id=2121 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      From the extensive communication which the nerves of the kidneys have with those of the alimentary canal, it is not improbable that the secretion of urine from the blood may commence before the absorbents have time to carry any quantity of water, received into the stomach, into the bloodvessels; nature being aware that these vessels would be overcharged, did not a separation of some of the watery fluid already in them immediately begin.
      (21.9%)

    </li>
    <li id=2122 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      That the secretion of the kidneys is much influenced by passions and ideas of the mind we need only instance in proof, the effects of fear on quadrupeds, infants, and even on adult men in suddenly increasing the quantity of urine, and producing an insurmountable desire to void it.
      (16.6%)

    </li>
    <li id=2123 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      In patients labouring under some difficulty from stricture in passing urine, the mind referring to the complaint will often greatly increase the secretion of that fluid, and multiply the calls to pass it from the body.

      The prostate gland, of which we shall speak more fully, when treating of the anatomy of the organs specially concerned in generation, is in immediate connexion with the neck of the bladder; although not in fact directly engaged in the process of generation, it is more intimately connected therewith, than any of the parts which have hitherto been considered.

      The testicles, or organs which secrete the semen, are nourished and supplied with blood by long and tenuous vessels which arise from the main arterial trunk, and are called the spermatic arteries; the blood which they thus receive, serves for the elimination and secretion of the seed,—a process which is effected by the pesuliar action of the testicles, and which secreting power affixes to these organs a value and importance in the human frame, not even second to that which attaches to those generally regarded by anatomists as the more noble, being those the destruction or serious impairment of the functions of which may involve loss of life.

      In the dead body it has often been found that air or any fluid when not thrown into the vas deferens with much force, will fill the vesicle before it enters the canal of the urethra, and on examining the contents of the vesicles, although the fluid contained near the fundus differs in color, consistence, and smell from the semen, yet that found near the neck is often very similar to it; or to the fluid contained in the enlarged extremities of the deferent vessels.

      The period of puberty occurs earlier in warm than in cold climates; in temperate countries, it takes place from the fourteenth to the seventeenth year; the passions of youths living in large cities and towns are however excited earlier than are those of the agricultural population, on account of the greater sources of temptation to which they are exposed.

      There are several reasons which might be alleged for the existence of a periodical desire for copulation among animals—were it otherwise, as the passion for sexual intercourse is very powerful, and animals do not possess the light of reason so as to be enabled to restrain or subdue their passions, it is probable that from its excessive indulgence, all their other habits might be lost, and even the necessity of providing for their present and future wants might be forgotten; besides which in those animals which are very fruitful, and which do not long carry their young, their number would be in a short time exceedingly great, far beyond the means of support that nature has provided for them.

      The various effects that urethral discharges have upon the animal frame, depend greatly on the influence they exert on the mind: in some, nocturnal emissions lay the foundation of seminal weakness and gleet, and cases occur where the system having long laboured under the influence of nocturnal emissions, feels more powerfully than it would under other circumstances the nervous irritation which usually accompanies a profuse discharge of the semen; proving beyond doubt, the existence of chronic debility; for that which has little effect on one constitution, will produce in others symptoms extremely harassing both to the body and mind; and thus a complex derangement arises, the combined result of a concatenation of events that may be traced, even with mathematical precision, to the debilitating cause: fcr we are led to infer that seminal weakness precedes this nervous derangement: and to us it is evident, that when nervous debility exists, the nocturnal emissions are increased; the repetition of them unquestionably weakens the vital energy, and after an indefinite period, predisposes the cerebral organs to morbid irritation.

      GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON THE

VENEREAL DISEASE.
      (7.0%)

    </li>
    <li id=3192 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The nature of a specific contagion, whence originates the disease we are now treating upon, and which has the property of inducing, in the individual who suffers from it, a secretion possessing the same characters and capable of reproducing the disease in others, presents to us on all sides, a variety of difficulties, springing principally from the various shapes it assumes, according to the constitution of the patient, the malignity and virulence of the poison, its duration, and many other, perhaps occult, causes.
      (20.2%)

    </li>
    <li id=3193 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      We know that it arises from the absorption of a specific morbid poison, generally imbibed during the act of coition with a person actually infected; and that thus produced, it is capable of assuming that variety of forms which it exhibits in different constitutions, and which, depending on the nature of the virus, and the nature of the constitution by which that virus is received, gives rise to that multiplicity of symptoms, which, in some constitutions are slight and in others malignant.
      (28.3%)

    </li>
    <li id=3194 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      This pre-disposition to contagion is powerfully manifested in some persons, while in others the power of repulsion or an inaptitude to its imbibition is equally exhibited.
      (8.4%)

    </li>
    <li id=3195 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      How frequently do we find, that one individual shall transgress with a female labouring under the venereal disease, yet no symptoms or evidence of infection follow; while another less fortunate, under similar circumstances, and perhaps even with the same female, will have the disease shew itself in its most virulent features; in short it is an indisputable fact, that every venereal case, is a case sui generis, for in no class of disease do we meet with cases less similar to each other, either in regard to the period the disease takes to develop its action, or the characters it may display; these contrarieties appear to be greatly influenced by the existing state of the individual system at the moment of contagion: a knowledge of these facts, however, points out the necessity of the adoption of an early and unequivocal line of conduct in the first stage of our fears, so that we may not afterwards have occasion to regret that the absence of more decided symptoms betrayed us into an indifference which may lead, and has not unfrequently led, to future embarrasment and considerable personal annoyance.

      The infection when it has been received in the usual way, within a certain time produces small ulcers, termed chancres, and afterwards, by irritating and inflaming the inguinal glands, when conveyed by the absorbents in its passage through them to the system, produces bubo in the groin.
      (15.0%)

    </li>
    <li id=3216 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      From external appearances, such as chancre, bubo, or other affections of different parts, we are usually guided in our opinions respecting the existence of this disease, yet the system may sometimes be affected by it, independently of the occurrence of either of these symptoms.

      By this single mark when we have no other leading symptoms, we may, in general, ascertain whether or not the patient be really affected with lues venerea, yet, it may often occur without previously producing either chancres, enlargement of these glands, or any other external sign of disease, though afterwards, blotches on the skin, ulcers on the tonsils, &amp;c, will convince us of its actual existence in the system as a secondary disease.

      Though less commonly, sensations somewhat similar to rheumatism and not unfrequently mistaken by patients for ordinary rheumatic wandering pains, affect different parts, which at length settle in one or other of the bones either of the skull or face, or else in the long bones as they are termed, generally the shin bone or clavicle.

      The order, then, in which the venereal symptoms generally appear, after the virus has been absorbed, and before it has been checked, is, first, in the form of chancre, next, bubo, then eruptions, or ulcers on the skin, ulcers in the throat, peculiar inflammatory affections of the eye, and affections of the bones.

      Stricture is a disease that obstructs the free passage of the urine, and causes it either to come in a small forked or twisted stream, or drop by drop, with considerable pain: if the urethral canal be not much diminished in calibre by the stricture, it may exist many years without producing any great degree of inconvenience; but though this may be the case respecting the evacuation of the urine, we are led to conceive that





the semen, in consequence, in the action of coition may not properly be directed into the vagina; for not issuing at the moment of ejaculation from the urethra, it afterwards falls merely by the effects of its specific gravity: of course attention to this stage of the disease becomes requisite; and more particularly in the advanced period of life, as the power by which the urine is evacuated, and the semen ejected necessarily becomes weaker.

      Although stricture may arise from constitutional causes, from malformation or spasm, or from other accidental circumstances, the cure of which must depend upon minute reference to the particular cause, yet the source of this distressing complaint, in nineteen cases out of twenty, is to be traced to venereal disease, or to an improper method of treating gonorrhea.

    <li id=3445 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      We may look upon the inflammation of gonorrhea, (after it has continued a long time,) as producing a new action in the vessels of the urethra at a particular point, by which a sort of membranous band is formed round the internal urethra, the circle of which being hard, and situated within the natural space is denominated a stricture.
      (19.7%)

    </li>
    <li id=3446 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      It may be considered that the urethra being hollow, muscular, and membranous, and naturally predisposed to contraction, is readily affected by inflammation or violence of any kind; but the progress of stricture is variable in different habits.

      The formation of a permanent stricture has been attributed to various causes; most of these have been already enumerated; there is one however not yet mentioned, which is popularly but erroneously considered to be a most efficient cause*—namely, the use of astringent injections in the treatment of gonorrhea and gleet.

    </li>
    <li id=3457 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The origin of this opinion may be readily traced to the fact that permanent stricture invariably depends on the results of inflammation in the deposition of lymph in the cellular tissue surrounding that part of the urethra where the contraction is found, and as gonorrhea is in itself a peculiar form of inflammation, from which persons labouring under stricture have generally previously suffered, and as generally the disease has been neglected, injections being had recourse to ultimately to remove a long standing effect, persons have been apt to attribute to the remedy, that which is in reality only due to the disease for which the remedy was used.

      Permanent stricture is characterised by a difficulty which is constantly experienced in the discharge of the urine, which comes away at first in a stream diminished in size, then forked or twisted, something like a corkscrew in shape, and afterwards, as the disease becomes more severe and the stricture more contracted, it is discharged only by a few drops at a time, and that too with excessive pain and difficulty.

      Nor is it a matter of astonishment, that where these habits, or venereal excitement, are frequent, some manifest effect should be produced on the constitution; the first more than the latter, because nature is more consulted by one action than the other: and as these organs first suffer, receiving their nervous ramification from the spinal marrow, it has been concluded (with some analogy to fact, we must confess) as the commencement of tabes dorsalis :—it may be the exciting, but never the predisposing cause.
