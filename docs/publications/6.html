      This brief summary of Venereal Affections has been constructed from the larger work on Syphilis, written by one of us.

      While preparing a new edition of the latter for publication, it appeared that the summaries at the end of each chapter of the book on &#39;Syphihs and Local Contagious Disorders&#39; might be usefully removed and issued in a separate form.

    </li>
    <li id=7989 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      In doing this we have endeavoured to bring the descriptions in accord with the knowledge of the present day.

      The chapters are numbered similarly in the small and in the large books, to assist readers when referring to the larger work for further information.

      We employ in this little epitome, as in the more compendious account, the term &#39;Syphilis&#39; only when speaking of the general disease, and the term &#39;Chancre&#39; exclusively for the local contagious venereal ulcer.

      In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the true nature of certain forms of syphilis prevailing in isolated districts was not recognised; hence the diseases called, at different times, yaws in the &quot;West Indies, sibbens in Scotland, radezyge in Norway, scherlievo in Dalmatia, and by other names in various parts of the world, were not considered to have a venereal origin, until proved to be simply varieties of syphilis.

      When the syphilitic poison, unmixed with matter from ulcers, has been inoculated, it gives no evidence of its presence for three weeks or a month; this period is called its incuhation.

    </li>
    <li id=8021 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Then it reveals its presence by induration of the tissue at the point of inoculation, and by the formation of an elevated papule, which may, or may not, become an ulcer with a hard base.

    </li>
    <li id=8022 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      About eleven days later than the appearance of the papule, several glands nearest the point of infection are found to have become slowly and painlessly enlarged.

    </li>
    <li id=8023 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Within a few weeks from this, usually four to six, a red macular eruption commonly appears on the chest and abdomen.

      The rash is often preceded by loss of appetite, and even by fever or headache.

      As the first eruption disappears, others develop, generally of a papular character, scattered over the surface of the body and on the mucous membranes, especially of the

      Having made this progress, the disease may subside completely, and never revive.

    </li>
    <li id=8030 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Usually, however, after two or three months of apparent quiescence, a fresh eruption of a scaly, or less commonly of a pustular character, appears on the skin, with excoriated patches on the fauces.

    </li>
    <li id=8031 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      They are accompanied in the more severe cases by rheumatoid and periosteal pain of the bones, iritis, and other symptoms.

    </li>
    <li id=8032 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The affection becomes either continuous by fresh crops of eruption following closely on each other, or, the spots alternately vanish and return, during a period not often exceeding two or three years.

    </li>
    <li id=8033 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      During this time it is common for the patient&#39;s strength and vigour to be greatly lessened.

      Thus the second period of the disease terminates.

      If it attack the skin, hard tubercles appear in that tissue, which are very prone to ulcerate.

      But the internal organs— liver, lungs, brain, and muscles—may be also the seat of similar solid formations, and of other changes.

    <li id=8038 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Syphilis, per se, is rarely fatal in adults; but by altering the structure of organs of vital importance, it renders the patient unable to repair accidental injury to those organs, and thus indirectly very frequently causes death.

    </li>
    <li id=8039 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Though the earliest manifestation is as much a part of the general disease as are the subsequent ones, it has been found convenient, from the character of the symptoms, to arrange them in three groups.

    <li id=8040 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      First, those developed at the point of contagion—

    <li id=8041 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      the so-called primary symptoms; next, the widely spread aflPections, observed mainly on the surface of the body, called secondary ; and lastly, those attacking nsnally a limited area, or a special organ, named tertiary affections.

    </li>
    <li id=8042 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      These sets of symptoms are usually separated by pauses.

    </li>
    <li id=8043 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Not invariably; for now and then patients present simultaneously symptoms proper to all three periods.

    </li>
    <li id=8044 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The morbid products of syphilis are histologically identical at all stages of the disease.

    </li>
    <li id=8045 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Under the microscope, the new material is the same both in the indurated site of the inoculation of the poison, and in the tumour of the liver or other parts developed in cases where the disease has long existed.

    </li>
    <li id=8046 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Contagfion is not repeated.

    <li id=8047 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      —By this it is meant that a man who has been inoculated with syphihs thereby gains an immunity for the future, and further inoculations have no effect upon him.

    </li>
    <li id=8048 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      This law, commonly true, is not absolutely so ; undoubted instances exist of patients having had syphilis, who, after a lapse of years, again contract the disease by a fresh contagion.

    </li>
    <li id=8049 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      In such cases of reinfection, syphilis is repeated in two ways; in the best recognised and undoubted mode, a regular recurrence takes place, namely, incubation, indurated initial lesion, enlarged glands, and eruptions of the cutaneous and mucous surfaces.

    </li>
    <li id=8050 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      In the second mode in which syphilis is said to be repeated, the course is much modified.

      In the second, the induration of the tissue beneath the ulcerating surface is less abundant, and sometimes, instead of being developed in a mass, it is spread in a thin layer under the surface which secretes a serous discharge; this form is called &#39;parchment induration.&#39;

      DESCRIPTION.

    </li>
    <li id=8790 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Chancre, or tlie local contagious sore, is produced by inoculating its discharge on a breacli of surface.

    </li>
    <li id=8791 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Often coexistent with syphHis, it maybe nevertheless considered distinct from that disease, as it causes no constitutional symptoms.

    </li>
    <li id=8792 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      It has no period of incubation ; it begins to irritate immediately, but the activity of its progress varies very much in different persons.

    </li>
    <li id=8793 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      It is generaUy discovered as a minute but well-defined spreading ulcer, about five or six days after contagion.

    </li>
    <li id=8794 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      It always causes destruction of the tissues around the point of inoculation.

    </li>
    <li id=8795 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      There are three varieties.

    </li>
    <li id=8796 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      In one, the sore reaches through the whole tHckness of the skin or mucous membrane, has an irregular form, and sharply cut edges; the floor is not hardened, but spongy and covered with tHck pus.

    </li>
    <li id=8797 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Another variety is very shallow, or prominent with spongy granulations over the surface.

    </li>
    <li id=8798 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The third variety is produced by the changes of acute inflammation and rapid destruction of tissue.

      of the local sore are, suppleness of the base, sharply defined area, irritating and abundant discharge, con-secutive inoculation of this discharge and the production of fresh sores; lastly, activity and liability to spread.

      Ulcers about the neck of the uterus are seldom true chancres, though undoubtedly they are so occasionally.

    </li>
    <li id=8803 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The main complications of chancre are inflammation, rapid sloughing, and slow prolonged phagedena.

    </li>
    <li id=8804 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The first is a consequence of irritation from violent exercise, debauchery, or other cause.

    </li>
    <li id=8805 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The second is produced by the same irritation acting on a very feeble or exhausted condition of the body.

    </li>
    <li id=8806 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The slow phagedena also generally occurs in debilitated persons, but its exciting cause is obscure.

      The diagnosis of the local from the syphilitic sore depends mainly on the absence of incubation; the activity of the ulceration; the tendency to multiplication ; the aspect of the ulcer; the absence of hardness in the base; the readiness with which it inflames and spreads ; and the ease with which it is repeated on the same person time after time.
