PREFACE TO THE SIXTY-SEVENTH EDITION.

    <li id=21 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Of all the diseases to which mankind is liable, there are few more dangerous, accompanied with more varied symptoms, or which attack a greater number of vital organs, whether simultaneously, or successively, than those resulting from the immoderate discharge of the seminal fluid.
      (18.0%)

    </li>
    <li id=22 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Difference of age, temperament, climate, season, profession, &amp;c, ceteris paribus, may induce different degrees of severity; but still they are all the same in kind, and require accordingly the same line of treatment, to be modified, of course, with respect to its activity, by individual circumstances.
      (15.2%)

    </li>
    <li id=23 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The commencement of these affections is, generally speaking, of a very insidious character, and frequently masked under the deceptive appearances of several other diseases: and what adds to the difficulty is, that the patient, so far from acknowledging the causes which have brought him to his wretched state more especially when such cause happens to be the hateful practice of masturbation, in general positively denies that he has ever indulged in such a practice, though he afterwards is forced to confess all.
      (22.5%)

    </li>
    <li id=24 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Should the unfortunate victim of self-pollution or excessive venery wilfully neglect his case, even after he has laid aside the debasing practice, he will linger, perhaps, for years, in a state of languor and debility; the joys of the marriage-bed and the delights of domestic happiness are for ever denied him; the love of offspring—the tenderest and most enchanting passion of the human heart—with him can never be gratified, his name and race will fade away and become extinct.
      (25.6%)

    </li>
    <li id=25 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Reduced by this execrable vice to the most abject state of human wretchedness— an object of commiseration to some who remember what he once was, in the full enjoyment of healthful vigor and manly promise, the fond idol of a mother&#39;s joy, the beloved staff of a father&#39;s hope in his declining age, now become a subject of ridicule to the heartless and unfeeling; pointed at by all as a beacon to caution others against the fatal rock on which his youthful hopes, and once brightened prospects, have been wrecked, is left to eke out a wretched and miserable existence, a prey to all the horrors of self-reproach, and a melancholy example of the vengeance of an angry God on those who, by abusing their bodies by the degrading habit of self-pollution, have, by the very worst and most sinful form of suicide, hurried themselves into a premature grave.

    </li>
    <li id=26 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      To point out these dismal but certain effects of this unnatural and hideous vice—to send forth a warning voice to those addicted to its practice-to palliate, to relieve, and finally to remove such sad effects— to restore and re-establish the pristine health and vigor, when impaired by this foul habit—such were the views—such the objects I entertained in preparing the First edition of &quot;Manhood&quot; in 1840; such are the sentiments—such the feelings, which now influence me in sending forth this the SIXTY-SEVENTH EDITION after the lapse of twelve years.

      The sale of 20,000 Copies Of This Wobk in so short a time, a fact, in corroboration of which I beg leave to subjoin the declarations before the Lord Mayor, first of my printer, and secondly of my bookbinder, cannot but be deemed a convincing proof of the large share of public confidence which I have enjoyed, and which I still continue to enjoy—an amount of confidence, in fact, which never could have been attained, did I not produce something of more sterling value than the idle parade of vain promises and empty professions, impudently couched in language pilfered and plagiarised.

    <li id=28 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      And here I feel called upon in justice to myself, as well as to the public, by way of Caution—to enter my decided and solemn protest against the daring effrontery and barefaced impudence of those ignorant pretenders to medical skill, who attempt to deceive the public by their announcements in the newspapers, professing to cure the same class of diseases to which I have devoted my exclusive energies for so long a period, and with such acknowledged and established success.

      In preparing the present improved and enlarged edition of &quot;Manhood,&quot; I have taken due care amply to avail myself of the vast experience, which, considering the unprecedented share of public confidence with which I have been favoured, I must necessarily have attained in a class of diseases for which Pathology has as yet done so very little, that the only sure guide for





# their successful treatment must be an enlightened and well-trained experience, based on the only sure foundation—Extended Practice.

      The object of the present Treatise is to describe the causes, both physical and moral, which lead to the practice of self-pollution; the terrific effects of this practice, and the best and most efficient means which can be adopted for its cure.

      The subject of Impuissance, or Sexual Debility, as being of singular importance, and one in which the interests of society at large, and not merely of its unhappy victims, are so vitally concerned, has received consideration in a separate and distinct article.
      (15.1%)

    </li>
    <li id=50 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      To this part of the subject I have paid the most anxious and untiring attention from a very early period of my professional career.

    <li id=51 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      It is one, in fact, in which not a day passes that I am not consulted, either by personal visit, or by correspondents in different parts of the kingdom, and I feel that I am not exceeding the limits of truth, nor transgressing the bounds of professional etiquette, in asserting that the mode of practice, suggested and improved by long and multiplied experience, has been productive of the happiest and most successful results in the treatment of sexual debility in both sexes.

    <li id=52 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The manner in which I have endeavoured to connect the effects produced by masturbation on the physiological functions of the several organs of the body, will, I trust, be found sufficiently clear even for the nonmedical reader.
      (17.3%)

    </li>
    <li id=53 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The accounts given in books with respect to the ruinous effects of onanism, cannot but appear exaggerated, unless the necessary connexion between these effects and the habit itself be clearly demonstrated.
      (11.4%)

    </li>
    <li id=54 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Hence arose the necessity of entering somewhat into the physiology of the organs, without which the pathological changes are, and must appear to be unintelligible and over-rated to the popular reader, for whom this work is in a manner almost exclusively destined.

      religion and our own reason would of themselves instruct us, that to destroy that end must be very offensive to God; and I cannot refrain from quoting the words of a learned divine, while speaking of this shameful and disgusting practice, &quot;The crime in itself,&quot; says he, &quot;is monstrous and unnatural—in its prdctice filthy and odious to extremity—its guilt is crying and its consequences ruinous—it destroys conjugal affectionprevents natural inclination—and tends to extinguish the hopes of posterity.&quot;

      This arises partly from the want of sincerity and candour on the part of the patient, who, not acknowledging the true source of his distemper, deceives and misleads his medical adviser; partly, also, from the medical practitioner himself not being accustomed to meet cases of the kind, or not having devoted sufficient attention to their investigation, without which it is impossible to attain that discriminating tact which is so necessary to detect the cunning and artifice practised by patients in concealing the destructive source of so many complicated maladies; the medical practitioner himself, from the causes now alleged, too often overlooks, or is deceived as to the nature of the case submitted to his treatment.

      Varicocele.
      (0.0%)

    </li>
    <li id=384 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Varicocele is one of those diseases which the male sex is particularly liable to, in consequence of the length of the spermatic veins, the pendulous state of the testicles, the uncertain quantity of blood that is sent into them, and their unfitness to return it; and I think that Varicocele is as common in the male sex, as the disease of fluor-albus, or whites, is in the female, that probably one person in every three suffers from the complaint, more or less.
      (27.9%)

    </li>
    <li id=385 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      It is a disease which arises through a general relaxation of the arterial and venous system, which relaxation is produced by various causes, but more commonly arises from the unnatural act of Selfpollution.
      (16.8%)

    </li>
    <li id=386 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      In the preceding portion of my work, I have endeavoured to explain that the blood is conveyed from the aorta, or great artery, into the testicles, for the purpose of being secreted into seed, so as to be ready for use in the vesicula seminales, under the wise dispensation of Providence, which is given to man for the voluptuous enjoyment of venery, and for the reproduction of mankind; the testicles are also provided with veins to carry away the blood after the seed has been secreted in the testicle, and returns through the vena cava, or great vein, to be purified by the lungs; it then returns back into the aorta again to perform its functional duties.
      (41.5%)

    </li>
    <li id=387 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Now it is evident that if unnatural means are used to produce the voluptuous enjoyment of venereal pleasure, the vessels become acted upon immoderately, the system is drained of its sap, or vital juice, which is difficult to replenish, so that, during the act of Selfpollution, or upon any unnatural excitement of the genitals, more blood is brought into the testicle than it has strength to secrete into seed; therefore the blood cannot pass through, and congestion takes place, inflammation follows, and mortification is the sequel: but the more common result of these acts of unnatural gratification is, that the veins in the testicles swell, and, by pressing continually upon the gland of the testicle, cause it to give way and dwindle, the muscular fibres of the testicle and scrotum relax, drop down, and hang devoid of any muscular power whatever, and when felt by the fingers appear like a bag of earthworms, exactly as shewn in the engraving, Plate 6.

      There are three kinds of Stricture, which are thus denominated,— the Permanent, Spasmodic, and Inflammatory.
      (9.3%)

    </li>
    <li id=433 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The Permanent Stricture is the result of a thickening of the urethra from chronic inflammation.

    </li>
    <li id=434 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The Spasmodic Stricture arises either from a contraction of the muscles surrounding the urethra, or from the urethra itself.
      (15.4%)

    </li>
    <li id=435 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The Inflammatory Stricture is produced through inflammation of the acute kind, which generally succeeds the acute Gonorrhoea.

    </li>
    <li id=436 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      At the commencement of the formation of every permanent Stricture there is a retention of a few drops of urine in the urethra,

B





after the whole appears to have been discharged; so that, when the penis has been returned into the small-clothes, the linen becomes slightly wetted, and if you press on the under side of the urethra a few more drops will be voided.
      (25.4%)

    </li>
    <li id=437 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The next circumstance is an irritable state of the bladder; which is evinced by the person not being enabled to sleep so long as usual without discharging his urine.
      (12.2%)

    </li>
    <li id=438 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      A man in good health will not be obliged to empty his bladder for eight or nine hours, and some can go for a longer time, but when he has a stricture, he cannot continue for a longer period than three or four hours, and frequently much less than this time.

    <li id=439 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The next circumstance in Stricture (and which is always a true prognostic of the existence of stricture) is the division of the stream; sometimes the stream splits in two, becoming forked; sometimes it is spiral; at other times it forms as it were a thin sheath.
      (23.2%)

    </li>
    <li id=440 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      In addition, there will be a discharge from the urethra, which renders the linen of a bluish white, similar to the appearances produced by nocturnal emissions; if the patient rides much on horseback, the urine will be high-coloured, which is dependent upon the degree of excitement existing in the urethra.

    </li>
    <li id=441 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The next circumstance the patient notices is, that he discharges his urine by drops; and, through the irritable state of the bladder, the water is continually dropping from the orifice of the urethra.
      (14.0%)

    </li>
    <li id=442 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The next circumstance observable is the discharge of a considerable quantity of mucus along with the urine; the urine when discharged is as transparent as usual, but when it has cooled, the mucus descends to the bottom, where it appears ropy, and adheres to the vessel.

    </li>
    <li id=443 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      As the inflammation of the membrane increases, the urine becomes yellow, but when allowed to cool the mucus sinks, to the bottom.

      Those parts of the urethra which are more commonly liable to be strictured, are these :— First, that portion anterior to the bulb, just where it joins the corpus spongiosum—this part is naturally contracted and small, as shewn in Plate 16, Fig. 1; there is also another part liable to stricture, which is near the glans penis.

      The last figure of Stricture (as shewn in Plate 16, Fig. 5) represents the urethra torn by a patient having improperly introduced a bougie, being driven to madness through not being able to pass his urine; this person forced a bougie, as he thought, through the Stricture, instead of which he had lacerated the urethra and a portion of the corpora cavernosa; inflammation followed, and death terminated his sufferings; whereas, by skilfully introducing a propal-sized bougie, his life might have been preserved.

    <li id=453 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The term Masturbation, from manus—the hand, and stupro—I defile, is the term more usually employed to express the idea intended to be conveyed in Holy Writ by the term Onanism, or the sin of Onan.

      I freely admit that this objection would not be devoid of weight, were the practice less extended and less indulged in; unfortunately, I have good reason to know, from the position in which I am placed as a medical practitioner, that the habit is so well understood, and so generally indulged in, that it requires not the aid of reading for its dissemination; nor is theory at all in danger of rendering that more general, or more alluring, which is now unfortunately so firmly established and so- deeply rooted in our manners by the almost overwhelming force of practice.

      It is an opinion entertained by many eminent and distinguished medical practitioners, an opinion, also, which seems to be supported by numerous and wellattested facts, that the diseases occasioned by indulgence in self-pollution become more frequent in proportion as society becomes more polished and more refined.

      As one of the most effectual means of bringing about this desirable result, I take the liberty of proposing that more importance should be attached to the moral education of children, a part of education almost entirely neglected by the moderns, who seem more anxious to expedite the development of the intellectual powers, and to store the minds of youth with the varied and multifarious branches of science and art, than to cultivate their moral faculties, and to direct them to the practice of virtue.

      Another cause which renders onanism more dangerous than excessive indulgence in coition, arises from the circumstance, that it is much easier to addict one&#39;s self to the one than to abuse the other; for when a man gives himself up without restraint to the natural pleasures of love, the fatigue felt as well by himself as by his companion, will have the effect of preventing his exhaustion; whilst on the other hand there is no bridle, no restraint on him who practises selfabuse: the former is ordinarily obliged to wait for a favourable moment to indulge in his excesses—every moment answers the purpose of the other—all he requires is mere solitude to procure his baneful gratifications: he constantly carries about him the sting which torments him; he alternately finds his imagination exciting his organs, and his organs inflaming his imagination; whilst the other, aroused only by persons of the other sex, can find an easy remedy in the absence of such.

      I have attained the age of thirty-nine years; I have been guilty of the great sin of self-abuse i I blame no one, as I believe the act was first suggested by my own depraved nature, when I was about the age of ten years, and from that time until the age of eighteen years, I practised the sin at intervals, varying from two or three days apart, and occasionally abstaining from it so long as two or three weeks or more; I believe I did not fairly suspect the evil of the practice until that age; I then made an effort to leave it off, but always failed after a struggle of a few weeks.
