    <li id=7128 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      I have endeavoured in this edition to render it more perfect, by arranging the various improvements medicine has made since my last was published; and for this purpose have selected whatever I thought would be conducive to the advantage of the reader, both from ancient and modern authors.

    </li>
    <li id=7129 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The advance of general science is the object I have in view, and which a reference to the two first volumes of The Spectator will, I flatter myself, fully elucidate ; particularly those articles relating to vaccination; for I certainly should have conceived myself extremely criminal, and completely at variance with the best interests of society and humanity, had I refused to the favourers of this new, and as yet imperfect doctrine, that fair discussion by which science can alone be advanced, and our condition meliorated.

    </li>
    <li id=7130 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Hitherto the investigation has been conducted without design or consistence, for never did a greater mass of confusion

      exist upon any subject; yet every man who places not a firm reliance on the preventive power of vaccination,, is deemed an enemy to social order, because he does not lose sight of particular facts, in order to yield up his opinion to a general impression, resulting from partial reasoning.

    <li id=7132 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      I do confess I feel myself at perfect liberty to differ in opinion from those hostile gentlemen to candour and liberality ; who feel offended because we do not receive a principle of their own creation, as one virtually fixed; and which principle as vet is a flash without a bolt; and I do maintain they attack the legitimate privilege of a Briton, when they calumniate rather than refute.

      A Society of Physicians, congregated to elucidate science and meliorate our condition, ought to have evinced a better respect for British feelings; and, as editors of an annual work, ought not to have been so lavish of personal abuse on a contemporary editor; and never did abuse come with worse grace from any body of men, who, with all the churlishness of Tin Edinburgh

      I am led to believe, that when the constitution has really been infected by the vaccine matter, it wvll resist the \anolous action; but while I concede to this doctrine, that requires the aid of experiment and time to bring it to maturity, I would have it understood, 1 do not yet recognize in vaccination the prevention of small pox: and this is as much as can be expected, while vaccination has acquired no decisive confidence.

    </li>
    <li id=7150 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      It is to me a matter of no small consolation, amid this hostile clamour, when I reflect, that notwithstanding the severe scrutiny my opposition to vaccination has undergone, the prejudice and envy it has given rise to, the fulminating and wanton invectives the hour of trepidation and despondency gave birth to, the extensive circulation those very insignificant libels (that merit my pity rather than my indignation) that were fabricated with singular severity, to deprecate me in public opinion, have had; not one fact I have advanced has been controverted, not one argument invalidated.

ceiving the sanction of Parliament, the arrangement of the different Jennerian stations, and the opportunity an eleven years of extensive, but superficial practice, must have given, vaccination has not yet furnished sufficient facts to establish its character of prevention, on that extended scale which alone can warrant society in its universal adoption.

      I am open to conviction, and though I am neither an infidel, a sceptic, or an alarmist, yet I must not meanly desert my principles, for the fear of continuing the victim of narrow and hypothetical reasoners; and particularly when an universal anxiety prevails, for supplying the place of fact by credulity.

    </li>
    <li id=7154 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      I certainly shall feel happy to see this question decided in the favour of vaccination, and will do all in my power to forward the views of the Royal College of Physicians in its introduction, but in its recommendation will not take upon me the responsibility of its success, and I congratulate Society, that at length this new practice is now placed under the direction of men well calculated to bring this important point to issue.

It has been the common custom of authors, under the head of the Venereal Disease, to place gonorrhoea and syphilis, or confirmed lues, as one and the same disease ; and this I presume has arisen, from a opposition that the same poison gives them both existence ; but I am of opinion, they are diseases, distinctly springing from matter, whose specific contagion is evidently very different: therefore, I shall consider them as two separate diseases ; but as they arise from an illicit connexion, to be the more clearly comprehended, I shall employ the term Venereal Disease, more as a class, than the name of the disease ; and as the preventive means are applicable to both diseases, I shall also give them under this general head.

    </li>
    <li id=7170 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      I shall first state the reasons for supposing the diseases do arise from the action of different specific contagions.

    </li>
    <li id=7171 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      If the same poison produced both diseases, should we not expect to find, that a^man with a chancre on the glans penis would

uniformly communicate the gonorrhoea, or clap to a woman ; inasmuch as the poison is first applied to a secreting surface in a woman, and vice versa.

    </li>
    <li id=7172 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      With persons in the habit of promiscuous intercourse, this point is very difficult to ascertain; but with married people it may be reduced to a certainty; for when a married man in the incautious hour of inebriety, contracts a venereal infection, he has uniformly communicated the same disease to his wife ; evidence of this fact is but too frequently met with in private practice.

    </li>
    <li id=7173 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      If therefore, a man with a chancre on his penis was capable of exciting this critical evacuation, the question would long ago have been answered, as one case would have established the fact; but no such case in the annals of medicine can be found : will it be contended, that this is not more than presumptive evidence?

    </li>
    <li id=7174 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      if in the laudable pursuit of medical researches, an individual can produce a well authenticated fact, of the existence of a gonorrhoea having arisen from a chancre, down goes the contest and controversy, and I stand completely refuted.

    </li>
    <li id=7175 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      No disease is so little in the power of the practitioner as gonorrhoea; sometimes it will spontaneously cease, without any means ; at other times it will equally surprize and distress us by consequences the most serious, when every proper remedy has been used.

    </li>
    <li id=7176 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      I will now take the subject in a new iigi*



Were the matter exciting both diseases, specifically the same, chancres and other symptoms of lues Venerea, would follow want of cleanliness in gonorrhoea ; lor I am in possession of no reason, why the virus of gonorrhoea, in that case, by lying on the tender skin of the glans penis in men, and inside of the labia in females, should not pro- .

      duce chancre, or, on being absorbed into the system, occasion bubo, and the other constitutional affections; for ulceration, it is a known fact, is not requisite for the introduction of this subtle virus into the circulation; on a very careful examination of ancient and modern records, no satisfactory instance can be found that bears analogy to such a case : again, my researches admit me to state, that if the matter of lues venerea be capable of exciting gonorrhoea, we should expect to find the latter disease, attending chancres, situated at the orifice of the urethra; such are daily met with ; hut an instance of gonorrhoea having followed, I have never met with, or heard of: again, if gonorrhoea be the production of the matter of lues venerea, acting on a secreting surface, why is not the same disease generated when applied to the secreting surfaces of the palate, nostrils and gullet, instead of which the accurate observer will find chancres in these situations are uniformly excited.

      Mercury, the grand remedy of this disease, manifests no specific effects in cases of gonorrhoea, although attended with suppuration, and consequent ulceration, and therefore is not recommended even by those who contend for the identity of the poison.

    <li id=7180 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Yet I am of opinion mercury ought to be given in its first stage ; because, should other symptoms follow, the constitution is prepared to receive them.

      The most important object of this treatise is to inculcate on the mind of every individual the necessity of extinguishing the venereal virus, without injury to the constitution; past experience and past misfortune, it is hoped, will teach practitioners to unite to their own experience, the experience of others; for, as the sagacious Dr. Friend justly remarked, “ a man may practise and practise all the days of his life, and yet never be the wiser for his experience, if he neglects to make the proper observations which that experience might suggest to him; and it is not very likely he should be over nice in his observations, who constantly goes on

      To prevent individuals falling into such hands, first induced me to write this treatise, that a blind credulity to a particular system might not hurry to a premature grave an unguarded individual, and to snatch him from the griping claws of deadly empiricism.

      Respecting the specific particles of the venereal virus, the researches of the chymist, and industry of the physiologist, have left us where they found us; for this hydra-headed monster is only known to exist in the constitution from the effects it produces ; experience, it is true, has taught us the utility of mercury, but experience has not yet explained its modus operandi on the venereal virus.

    </li>
    <li id=7186 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">

of a different nature, require a different treatment the truth of the above authority must forcibly strike every attentive observer of the effects of the lues venerea, for there is no disease to which the human body is subject of which it does not partake in some of its most prominent stages.

    </li>
    <li id=7188 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      I shall proceed to give a brief description of the different species of the venereal virus as it arises in succession, with a general mode of treatment for the same.

    </li>
    <li id=7189 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      From the sufferings of mankind, under this disease, it has been a favourite object ever since its appearance, to endeavour, by remedies, to prevent its attack.

    </li>
    <li id=7190 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The remedies for this purpose have been very numerous, and it will be needless to tire the patient with a list of them.

    </li>
    <li id=7191 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The most successful are those which proceed on the principle of decomposing the poison ; and the following forms are of this kind:

Take of muriate of mercury, one grain; dissolve it in a.

    </li>
    <li id=7192 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      pint of common spring water, and filter it through paper; of this solution, mix a little in a tea-cup of water; and if the mouth can bear it ■without pain, it is fit for use.

    </li>
    <li id=7193 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      A syringe is then to be filled with it, and injected into the passage, either of the female or male, retaining it there for about half a minute, after which, the external parts may be washed with the same solution, and the whole finished with washing it away with warm water.

    </li>
    <li id=7194 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Another preventive is the caustic alkali;



a few drops put into water, of such strength that the tongue can bear without pain, may be used in the same manner as the former solution ; cleanliness itself will also have a considerable effect, independent of any remedy whatever ; and of this, women themselves, who are engaged in promiscuous connexions with the other sex, aie well convinced.

    </li>
    <li id=7195 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Covering the glans penis with the strong mercurial ointment is another remedy which also may be applied with success, if applied before and after coition.

    </li>
    <li id=7196 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Lime water, and a solution of the extract of lead, has also been used ; as well as lemon

juice, and diluted spirits.

    </li>
    <li id=7197 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Nay, the disease itself, as has been alleged by some writers, acts in a certain degree in its consequences as a preventive.

    </li>
    <li id=7198 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      lor where a person has suffered more than one attack, the parts become as it were habituated to the action of the poison, and are not so easily aflected as at first, for they lose in a certain degree that sensibility they originally possessed, and which tended to render therfi moie susceptible of infection.

    </li>
    <li id=7199 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      This is instanced by the ease with which a person, on his first entiance upon the pleasures of the town, becomes the victim of disease ; while the debauchee, or those accustomed to promiscuous indulgences, feel no inconvenience from their various illicit intercourses, even where it is hardly possible but infection must have been present.

    </li>
    <li id=7200 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      From the first appearance of the venereal disease, such remedies have been considered of great service ; the daily occurrence, however, of the disease, after so so many, and various attempts to prevent its contagion, is the best proof of our ignorance respecting the Specific nature of this poison ; and though we may attempt by these means to guard against its effects, yet we should not let ourselves be lulled into a fatal security against its attack.

    </li>
    <li id=7201 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      I know of no author who has laid down rules sufficiently explanatory to a patient in the use of the syringe; therefore, to obviate an omission of no small consequence, I think the following will answer.

    </li>
    <li id=7202 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      SYRINGE.

    </li>
    <li id=7203 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The patient, prior to using the injection, should make water; and, on the introduction of the sv-ringe with his left hand, let him grasp the bottom part of the penis, so as to prevent any portion of the injection descending into the bladder: the injection ought to be repeated eight or ten times a-day ; for on laying aside the use of the injection, the running often returns where this has not been attended to.

    </li>
    <li id=7204 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">

      Clap is a critical discharge from the urinary passage in the male, in consequence of the operation of a specific matter, and this generally happens with the last drops of seed of coition, which are apt to be retracted and carried back into the passage, as the parts collapse ; its first symptoms are a little redness and swelling at the orifice, which soon shows a watery discharge flowing from it, and becomes a running of a whitish or yellowish matter in the course of a little time ; the disease becomes then as it were established.

      The seat of the discharge is at first not above an inch and a half within the Oiifice of the passage, but it gradually proceeds upwards as the disease gains ground.

      It has been common in describing this affection or Clap, to divide it into three stages; the first stage is marked by a troublesome itching at the point of the yard, aud the orifice open, from which matter can be pressed.

    </li>
    <li id=7209 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      These appearances are succeeded by a swelling fuluess and tightness of the membrane; a sense



of heat pervades the whole passage, which changes to acute pain, anrl is severe on making water, producing what is termed scalding; along w ith these feelings in the part, the discharge undergoes various changes ; at first thin, and of a yellowish green colour, it changes to be more viscid, and i3 afterwards tinged with blood ; the member is also at times stiffened through its whole extent, or erected, in consequence of the inflammation producing what is termed chordce, from the irregular contraction or curvature of its under part.

    </li>
    <li id=7210 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      This circumstance is most frequent at night when w&#39;artn in bed.

    </li>
    <li id=7211 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Along with these symptoms of the part, there is sometimes felt a general uneasiness in the loins, testicles, and bladder, which not unfrequently affects the whole of the lower belly.

    </li>
    <li id=7212 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      If a Clap is left to itself, these symptoms will continue for a fortnight; at the end of that period they begin to abate, by the heat of the urine becoming less severe, by the discharge taking on a white appearance, and by the erections giving way.

    </li>
    <li id=7213 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      This is considered the second stage of the complaint; and when the abatement of the former symptoms proceeds still farther, so that the discharge is of a ropy viscid nature, then the disease is drawing to a termination, and a cure may be soon expected.

    </li>
    <li id=7214 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Though in a Clap this cure would take place by the efforts of nature alone, without any interference of medicine, yet few patients could submit to the length of time



necessary for this, nor suffer the painful feelings to •which they must be subjected for a long period; besides, these symptoms, by harassing the constitution, might lay the foundation ot more seiious maladies, and in weakly habits would injure the person, by the continuance of the discharge.

    </li>
    <li id=7215 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      On the first appearance of the Clap, the cure should be immediately attempted; nor time lost till the disease has established itself.

    </li>
    <li id=7216 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      VY e shall not enter into the various methods which have been attempted for curing this disease; a patient requires to know hut one method, and it is the object Oi the author here to point out, from his owu experience, what he has found most successful.

    </li>
    <li id=7217 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      From the symptoms of inflammation which have been described, the first step is to abate this inflammatory state, by opening the bowels by the following cooling

purge :

Take of Epsom Salts, one ounce Nitre, half a drachm.

    </li>
    <li id=7218 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      To be dissolved in a cupful of hot water, and to be taken at night.

    </li>
    <li id=7219 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      After the operation of this medicine, the regular use of the specific remedy is then to be begun, the preparation of which is as follows:

Take of White Sublimate, ten grains Sweet Spirit of Nitre, one ounce Compound Spirit of Lavender, thirty drops.

    </li>
    <li id=7220 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Mix the whole together, and of this mixture let fifteen drops be taken in a glass of water, morning and evening.

    </li>
    <li id=7221 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The effect of this medicine is to check the progress of the specific inflammation; and by this means the symptoms will of course abate.

    </li>
    <li id=7222 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      But though it thus mitigates all the other svmptoms, it does not possess an influence sufficiently powerful over the discharge.

    </li>
    <li id=7223 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      In addition, therefore, to the drops, a medicine, which it is necessary to join with them, is as follows :

Take of Wood, or Spurge Laurel Powder, and

Ohio Turpentine, each half a drachm.

    </li>
    <li id=7224 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      To be made with fine flour into twenty-four pills, two of which are to be taken at night, and two in the morning ; which, besides checking the discharge, will have the effect of keeping the body gently open.

    </li>
    <li id=7225 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      By this practice the author has found an uniform success in curing the Clap; he does not deny, that there may perhaps be cases that will resist this, and every other remedy; but he will say with confidence, that he has never found this fail him, and on that account he is induced to recommend it to the use of patients in this strong manner.

    </li>
    <li id=7226 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Should any of the symptoms resist this practice, particularly the chordee, then the following ointment is to be rubbed along the pipe, or under part of the member ;



Take of Mercurial Ointment, one ounce Powdered Opium, and Camphor, of each half a drachm.

    </li>
    <li id=7227 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      To be mixed with the mercurial ointment, and the whole made thin by the addition of sweet oil, so as to form a liniment; a little of this is to be rubbed once or twice a day, as already recommended.

    </li>
    <li id=7228 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Flannel soaked in cold water and put round the penis, will also remove it, and when the inflammation is very great, the following’ lotion used the Same as the water, will relieve :

Take one drachm of Sugar of Lead One drachm of the Tincture ot Opium And one quart of Water.

    </li>
    <li id=7229 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Where a patient is late in applying fcfr assistance, and symptoms of strangury, or difficulty of making urine, which passes only in drops, with much pain, comes on ; in this case the inflammation must be subdued before any other plan is attempted.

    </li>
    <li id=7230 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      If the pain is very severe, and the patient of a plethoric habit, bleeding will be necessary ; after which the following bolus may be taken, providedjjie body is already open, and if not, the cooling purge formerly recommended may precede it:

Take of Camphor, four grains Crude Opium, two grains

Conserve of Hips, as much as is sufficient to form it into a bolus.

    </li>
    <li id=7231 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Which is to be repeated every night, till the stran-



gury Is relieved ; and during the day, the following powders may be taken, to the number of two or three in the course of it:

Take of Powdered Gum Arabic, half a scruple Nitre, eight grains.

    </li>
    <li id=7232 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      To be rubbed into powder, with a little white sugar, for one dose.

    </li>
    <li id=7233 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      When the strangury is relieved bv the above means, then the plan formerly directed must be had recourse to, in order to complete the cure.

      During the progress of every Clap, an attention to cleanliness cannot be too much recommended, by frequently washing the parts with lukewarm milk and water, to prevent the acrimony of the discharge, which is apt to fret the skin where it touches ; and to prevent this, it may also be proper to cover the point of the yard with a small bit of lint, to absorb the matter.

      Some men have imbibed the beastly idea that the best way of getting rid of a clap,, is by connection with a healthy woman ,* the criminality and stupidity of such a notion is apparent, when we consider the nature and the seat of the disease, and can only arise from want of information on this point.

      The symptoms of Clap in women are pretty much the same as those in the male; but, from the different situations of the parts, and that the urine is not discharged by the same passage which forms the seat of the disease in men, they are not apt to arise to the same violence.

    </li>
    <li id=7251 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Clap is, therefore, a milder disease in women than in men; the principal symptom in them, is the discharge; which is however, more apt to excoriate and fret the surrounding skin, than it does in men : the disease in them is also more difficult to cure.

    </li>
    <li id=7252 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      An attention to these differences, is all that is necessary to cure: in regulating the treatment, the same plan already



directed, must be put in practice ; but as the inflammatory symptoms are not so violent, the drops and pills can be almost immediately begun, and continued in a regular manner till the cure is completed.

      In using it, it should be very frequently employed ; aud in order to be successful, the patient must place herself in a proper position, and her breech well elevated, and the syringe should be very broad pointed, so as accurately to fill the passage, and prevent the escape of the liquor till it has reached every part of the seat of the disease.

      So mild has this complaint often been known in the female, that a woman has given the infection for years to those who have cohabited with her, while no symptoms of it appeared, or were even known to herself.

      In every female case of lues venerea, mercury alone ought to be depended upon, because we cannot positively determine the source of the disease ; it may be only a gonnorhoeal discharge, but in case a concealed chancre existed, such a circumstance would materially injure the patient, while by treating it as syphilis w r e are sure to meet the disease.

      Paraphymosis is a retraction of the praeputium penis behind the glans penis, so that it cannot be drawn over the glans, owing to too great a fulness of the glans, produced by inflammation, occasioned by venereal virus, or any other acrid humour lurking behind the glans, under the prepuce.

      Phymosis is an inflammatory swelling of the prepuce, arising from the same causes as paraphymosis, occurring to such a degree of inflammation, as to render it impossible to draw the prepuce behind the glans.

      John Hunter, to whom ve must all look up with veneration, has left the question totally undecided ; we will give it in his own words :

“ In those cases, where violent inflammation has



attacked the seat of a chancre producing pbymosis as before described, and often so as to threaten mortification, a question naturally arises—Is mercury to be given freely to get rid of the first cause ?

      T\o-* thing but experience can determine this; I should incline to believe, that it is necessary that mercury should be given, for I am afraid our powers to correct such a constitution, while the first cause subsists, are too weak ; however, on the other hand, I believe the mercury should be given sparingly, for if it assists in disposing the constitution to such symptoms, we are gaining nothing, but may lose by its use ; I therefore do suppose, that such medicines as may be thought necessary for the constitution should be given liberally, as well as the specific ; bark is the medicine that probably will be of most general use; opium, in most cases of this kind, will also be of singular service ; the bark should be given in large quantities, and along with it mercury, whilst the virus is still supposed to exist; or if the inflammation has arisen early in the disease, they may then be given together, so as to counteract both diseases, and not to allow the inflammation to come to so great an height as it would otherwise do, if mercury was given at first alone.

      Where inflammation alone exists, a sedative lotion may remove it ; and when the inflammation has subsided and the wound assumes a more healthy action, a mercurial course may be begun, half a drachm to be rubbed in each night.

      In all venereal cases I prefer the



introduction of mercury by this mode, and I am well convinced that less injury is done to the constitution by it, and that its effects are more certain, and this ought to be continued till the- mouth is well affected; when, till the chancre heals, the alterative course may he begun.

      This mode of practice is adapted to both these states of inflammation ; paraphymosis is of a more alarming nature than the other, and often puts the patient’s life in danger; practitioners are too well &#39; acquainted with the plan that is to be pursued in cases of surgical operation to require information here, and the condition of the parts are too seriously affected to he left to the guidance of the patient, therefore, in every inflammation of the penis, the patient ought instantly to apply for medical aid ; and where serious injury arises, the patient has generally only to thank himself for his own negligence.

Is a sore on the outer skin, in consequence of the application of venereal matter.

    <li id=7280 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      This sore shows no disposition to heal: it becomes thickened at its base, and its inflammation extends : the time, after infection, at which it makes its appearance, is three or four days, though it is often as early as twenty-



four hours, and on other occasions it shows itself at the distance of some weeks ; it is preceded a sense of itching in the part, and its seat is most commonly within the foreskin or on the nut, though every part exposed to infection may be equally occupied bv it.

    </li>
    <li id=7281 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">

    <li id=7282 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The constitution of the person determines much the appearance and progress of the sore in chancre; if it shows a strong tendency to spread, and gets very foul under the use of medicine, then

it is a complaint highly alarming.

    </li>
    <li id=7283 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">

    <li id=7298 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Should both these forms of medicine disagree with the patient, from a delicate state of the stomach and bowels, then the medicine must be introduced by the skin in the form of unction ; for this purpose, let half a drachm to a drachm of common blue ointment be rubbed in every night upon the inside of the thigh, occasionally shifting the part of the skin or surface from one thigh to the other, to prevent excoriation.

    </li>
    <li id=7299 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      But w here the chancre has appeared for some time, presents a large surface, and has evidently tainted



the habit, then the application of the caustic will not destroy the disease, and other local forms will be more effectual.

    </li>
    <li id=7300 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      These forms may either consist of an ointment cr wash ; the ointment most commonly employed is the red precipitate, or calomel, which is as follows :

Take of Red Precipitate, one drachm ; or.

    </li>
    <li id=7304 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      With this ointment the sore is to be dressed, by spreading a little of it on a piece of lint.

    </li>
    <li id=7305 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      If the chancre is not situated on the external surface, but within the foreskiu, it may be touched with a little of the ointment by means of a hair pencil.

    </li>
    <li id=7306 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      This ointment the author has found more efficacious than most others ; and though a great variety are in use, it would only confuse a patient to insert any more.

    </li>
    <li id=7307 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      But in many cases of chancre, as ointments or oily applications disagree with the skin, the form of a wash is found a preferable application.

    </li>
    <li id=7308 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The best wash the author has found to be a solution of caustic, as follows :

Take of Lunar Caustic, eight grains.

    </li>
    <li id=7309 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Rose Water,, eight ounces.

    </li>
    <li id=7310 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Mix them till the caustic is dissolved ; then wash the chancre with a little of it three or four times





a day.

    </li>
    <li id=7311 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Where a mercurial wash is preferred, the corrosive solution serves very well, of the following strength :

Take of Corrosive Sublimate, twelve grains.

    </li>
    <li id=7312 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Lime Water, eight ounces.

    </li>
    <li id=7313 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Mix them together ; to be used in the same manner -as the former.

    </li>
    <li id=7314 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      In women, chancres show much the same appearance as they do in men ; but from the different structure of the parts, as women expose a greater extent of surface than men for infection, chancres in them are apt to be more numerous, and in the treatment of them it is also more difficult to apply dressings ; their cure, therefore, must be trusted more to internal medicines than external applications: and of the latter, the form of wash will suit them best.

    </li>
    <li id=7315 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The cure of chancres in general, do not exceed from three weeks to a month ; during that time the mouth should be kept slightly affected by the internal medicines, or the gums show that red or slightly inflammatory state which marks the proper action of the remedy.

    </li>
    <li id=7316 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      It is only by absorption, or forming a chancre, that the venereal poison is introduced into the body ; which is termed its primary action : under certain circumstances, the matters of clap and pox give rise to different symptoms, which are generally described as the consequences of this primary action of the poison.

    </li>
    <li id=7317 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      It is of the first importance to attempt to cure this stage as early as possible ; and had I my choice.

    </li>
    <li id=7318 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      I certainly should destroy the venereal virus by friction ; hut when this cannot he submitted to, the mode directed above must be complied with, according to the particular situation of the patient : the mouth ought early to be affected, for by it you correct the virulence of the poison, aud by exciting irritation in a different part, stop the progress of inflammation round the glans penis; should the prepuce slough, bark ought to be conjoined with the mercury, and the parts kept clean by applying a linseed poultice e\ery four hours ; if during the separation of the parts hemorrhage comes on, it ought not to be prematurely stopped, for it is a salutary effort of nature to relieve herself; bark, not opium, is here to be depended upon ; and whose operation I would invariably assist by small doses of tartar emetic.

    </li>
    <li id=7319 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      There is not one effect of this disease so singularly peculiar to itself as this, and w&#39;ben it has once appeared, we are to consider general infection as having actually taken place; for if we flatter ourselves the complaint is here merely local, and the constitution not yet contaminated, we should place too firm a reliance on hypothetical reasoning, as i will venture to affirm, in opposition to an established axiom of a celebrated teacher, that we never can distinguish with certainty, a ve nereal pimple from one which is not so ; therefore, I hold it as an invariable practice to treat such pimples as venereal ones, and in nine cases out of ten we shall be correct.

      OF BUBO.

    </li>
    <li id=7321 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Bubo is a swelling from chancre, or a venereal sore situated on the nut, foreskin, or any way externally ; the infection, when the sore is not immediately destroyed, is conveyed through the vessels that open into it, to the hrst glands in their course, which are those of the groin ; it there occasions a painful inflammation and tumour, which begins with some degree of hardness and swelling, not larger than a kidney bean.

    </li>
    <li id=7322 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      As the swelling increases, it becomes paintul, and the person walks with difficulty : The skin over it becomes red and inflamed, rising into a tumour, with a good deal of throbbing and pulsation in it; in the course of a week or ten days, it becomes often larger than a pullet’s egg.

    </li>
    <li id=7323 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The infection which occasions bubo, generally takes place in the first stage of a chancre, or in eight or ten days after its first appearance.

    </li>
    <li id=7324 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The inflammation in the glands would seem, as it were, a temporary effort of the constitution to resist the farther progress of the poison.

    </li>
    <li id=7325 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      In some .

    </li>
    <li id=7326 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      cases, the infection has been known to pass into the habit, without the appearance of chancre, and the infection from chancre may also be carried into the body, without any bubo, or swelling of the groin being formed, as the whole vessels arising from the



parts of generation do not constantly pass through the glands of the groin.

    </li>
    <li id=7327 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Bubo is very frequently produced by irritating applications to a chancre, which renders the vessels more active and more fit for absorption.

    </li>
    <li id=7328 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The treatment of bubo, is a point that often requires much judgment: like every other glandular swelling, it either subsides without breaking the skin, or it comes to a head, and discharges a quantity of matter, by the skin of the part giving way.

    </li>
    <li id=7329 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      It has often been disputed whether it is better to make it subside without breaking the skin, or to bring it to a head, when a sore is afterwards left to be healed.

    </li>
    <li id=7330 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      This point must be left to the constitution of the patient.

    </li>
    <li id=7331 style="background-color: rgba(255, 251, 204, 0.35676004759689817);">
      If the patient discovers a strong healthy habit of bodv, and the swelling shews symptoms of active inflammation, the best method is then to bring it to a head, and this will take place very quickly ; the sore that succeeds will be trifling, it will heafup in the course of a few days, and the patient is then sensible he is, in the end, to be thoroughly well,

• without any risk of the disease re-appearing at a future period : but where, on the contrary, the patient discovers a weakly constitution, and there is suspicion of some hereditary taint, as a scrofulous disposition, then the swelling should be made to subside as soon as possible, and the breaking of the skin not endangered, from the certainty that the sore would prove troublesome in the healing, and



the health of the patient might materially suffer under the long discharge that would necessarily ensue ; at the same time, it is to be observed, that in all cases of the subsiding of bubo, some small hard knots always remain, which resist the action of the remedies employed, and lengthen out also the period of the cure; besides it cannot be absolutely determined, but some lurking venereal disposition may be concealed in those hard knots, and occasion the disease to break out at some distant time.

      to be done, where the swelling is to be dispersed, without coming to a head.

    </li>
    <li id=7334 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The first point, in all cases of bubo, or swelling of the groin, is to begin the use of mercury, and in order that it may be made as active as possible on the part, it should be made to pass through the seat of the disease : it should therefore be introduced by unction, in the manner formerly stated under chancre, by being rubbed every night, in the quantity of half a drachm to a drachm, upon the thigh of the affected side, and if the skin should become fretted, the rubbing from the surface should be changed to the belly, or any part of the extremity not affected.

    </li>
    <li id=7335 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Much attention of the patient is necessary to conduct the rubbing properly ; it should be steadily and regularly persevered in, and not less than twenty minutes consumed at a time in doing it, in order that the remedy may be completely introduced



into the skin ; along with (his treatment, the subduing the symptoms of inflammation is not to be neglected ; when there is much inflammation, the application of leeches may be made ; a spare diet should be strictly adhered to, and the bowels kept regular by the use of cooling purgatives, such as were formerly recommended under the head, of clap.

    </li>
    <li id=7336 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Rest will also form an essential part of the treatment, as every motion of the body affects the part: it is also common to apply a plaster o\er the swelling, and this maybe done so soon as some appearance of subsiding takes place ; the plaster commonly used is as follows: Take of the common mercurial plaster spread on leather, of a proportion cut somewhat larger than the size of the swelling: the skin over the swelling should be

first shaved, and rubbed with mercurial ointment, that the plaster may apply closer* and it should be cut in the edges, to make it firmly adhere.

    </li>
    <li id=7337 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      If the swelling give much pain, an opiate may be given to abate it, and the form already noticed, under the head of Swelled Testicles, will answer the purpose; in this manner, the plan of treatment is to be conducted, and the unction of the mercury continued for some time after all morbid appearances are gone, which cannot be less than five or six weeks.

    </li>
    <li id=7338 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      But when an opposite termination of the disease is wanted, or the swelling is to be brought to a head, then the proceedings must be



directed to increase instead of diminishing the inflammation of the part.

      For this purpose, the application of a warm poultice will be proper, which should be renewed occasionally through the day : the poultice may be made in the following manner : Take a sufficient quantity of the soft of bread, and soak it in boiling water for a few minutes, gently pressing olf the superfluous fluid ; then beat it to a pulp, and add as much linseed meal as will render the whole somewhat tenacious, it should be spread on linen cloth, about the thickness of a quarter of an inch, and a little oil spicad upon it before being applied; it is to be retained in its place by a bandage put round the waist, and another brought between the thighs, or still better by the common suspensory bandage, which may be had of all the truss-makers.

      The preceding is the regular progress of bubo, where the habit of the patient is good, and the swelling possesses an active venereal disposition, yet the case is very different when the same disease occurs in a weakly constitution, and where it is combined with other latent maladies; thus the sore in bubo, instead of healing kindly, on the contrary, enlarges much, is attended with great pain, becomes thickened in its edges, and discharges a thin ill smelling matter.

      By this treatment the swelling will soon abate, and the testicles be reduced to their natural size ; but, should some stiffness and hardness remain, mercurial unctiou may then be had recourse to, and a hemlock poultice applied to the

      Mr. Lawrence has lately traced a peculiar affection of the testicle, which I shall here give you in his own words :

“The patient in this affection has generally assigned some blow or other injury as the cause of the complaint ; in other instances it has originated in the hernia humoralis from gonorrhoea, and sometimes has appeared spontaneously.

    </li>
    <li id=7378 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      A painful swelling of the gland, particularly characterized by its hard-



ness, is the first appearance of the disease.

    </li>
    <li id=7379 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      After a certain length of time, the scrotum growing gradually thinner, ulcerates, but the opening which is thus formed, instead of discharging matter, gives issue to a firm and generally insensible fungus.

    </li>
    <li id=7380 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The surround in 2: integuments and cellular substance are thickened and indurated by the complaint, so that there appears to be altogether a considerable mass of disease.

    </li>
    <li id=7381 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The pain abates, and the swelling subsides considerably when the scrotum has given way.

    </li>
    <li id=7382 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Tn this state the disorder appears very indolent, but if the fungus be destroyed by any means, the integuments come together and a cicatrix ensues, which is inseparably connected with the testicle.

    </li>
    <li id=7383 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      “An examination of the part while the fungusstill remains, discloses to us the fact, that this growth has its origin in the glandular substance of the testes itself, that the coats of the part are destroyed to a certain extent, and that a protrusion of the tubuli seminiferi takes place, through the aperture thus formed.

    </li>
    <li id=7384 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      I have often ascertained the continuity of the excrescences with the pulpy substance of the testes, of which we shall find more or less remaining, according to tlje dilference of the period of the disorder.

    </li>
    <li id=7385 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      It appears that the glandular part of the testes experiences an inflammatory affection in the, first instance, in consequence of the violence inflicted on it, and that the confinement of the swollen substance by the dense and unyielding tunica



albuginea, sufficiently explains the peculiar hardness of the tumour, and the pain which is always attendant on this stage of the disorder.

    </li>
    <li id=7386 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The absorption of the coats of the testes and of the scrotum, obviates the tension of the parts, and thereby restores ease to the patient, and at the same time that the fungus makes its appearance externally.

    </li>
    <li id=7387 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      “ It is not improbable that if the complaint were left entirely to itself, the swelling would subside, the fungus shrink, and a complete cure ensue, w ithout any professional assistance ; but the disorder is so indolent in this stage, that a spontaneous cure would not be effected until after a very long time.

    </li>
    <li id=7388 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The excrescence may, however, be removed by the knife, or if the nature of its attachment permit, by ligature, or it may be freely treated with escbarotic applications.

    </li>
    <li id=7389 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The removal of the protuberance to a level with the scrotum, by means of the knife, is the shortest and most effectual mode of treatment.

      There can be no ground whatever for proposing castration in this malady, since in no part of its progress, nor in any of its possible consequences or effects, can it expose the patient to the slightest risk.

    </li>

      Some may be disposed to defend tlie removal of the part, because it would bring the case to a more speedy termination, and if a patient, after beins: informed of all the circumstances, should de-*ire the operation, on this ground the surgeon would be justified in performing it.

    </li>
    <li id=7392 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      But he never



could be warranted in proposing so painful and dangerous a remedy as castration, for a disorder attended with neither pain nor damage, and admitting of cure by a perfectly safe and mild kind of treatment.

      WASTING OF THE TESTICLES

      GLEET.

      Various have been the opinions respecting Gleet, the ancients termed all emissions from the urethra gonorrhoeas, whether they proceeded from seminal, mucous, or purulent matter : but the moderns have distinguished it into two species, the malignant and simple.

    </li>
    <li id=7403 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Of the malignant w r e have treated; that of the simple comes under the present head ; which is an affection of the parts of generation, accompanied by a mucous discharge, occasioned by a continuance of the discharge, after all the symptoms of gonorrhoea are gone : these symptoms arise from atony of the parts, from ulceration, inflamed glands, &amp;c.

    </li>
    <li id=7404 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      but where gonorrhoea ends and gleet begins, I must confess I cannot precisely point out; vet I think we shall not materially err, if we consider gleet to commence when all inflammatory symptoms have ceased; gleet is a term so apparently simple, that its progress es rarely regarded by those who labour under it; and medical practitioners have considered it of so benign a nature, as to attach little importance to it; and the mode adopted for its cure often



leaves a worse disease than that it was intended to remove.

    </li>
    <li id=7405 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      For my part, I always undertake these cases with considerable anxiety, and would sooner have the cure of the disease, under any other form ; and experience proves the disease has frequently taken a course beyond the power of medicine to assist or stop; for this incipient stage may lay the foundation of very serious evil.

    </li>
    <li id=7406 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The existence of gleet may be detected by a minute examination of the discharge ; the matter discharged by the urethra durino- the tirst stage of gonorrhoea, has the distinct character of pus; during its progress, the inflammatory action ceases, and the parts gradually assume their healthy functions ; but when it resists this salutary action of nature, whatever may be its cause, the discharge does not abate, but changes the pus into a thin watery fluid, whitish and opaque.

    </li>
    <li id=7407 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      In this stage, and as it advances more to the cbaiac-ter of gleet, it becomes transparent, mucous, and glairy, till at length it actually assumes that decided character we call gleet, by the discharge becoming more viscid and clammy ; and the decided character that gleet here takes, points out in the most forcible manner, the distinction that virtually exists between gleet and seminal weakness ; and unless this distinction is minutely attended to, much error and confusion&#39;will arise.

    </li>
    <li id=7408 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      I am therefore anxious under this head to mark the distinction in unequivocating terms; and as I neither aspire to singularity, or to



a superior line of practice from other practitioners, to whose merit I shall feel always happy to contribute, I shall endeavour to place this intricate subject in as clear a light as fact and analogy allow me to go.

    </li>
    <li id=7409 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      I he stage we distinguish by the term malignant gonorrhoea, can alone arise from venereal excitement; gleet owes its existence to a morbid state of the urethra; while seminal weakness rises, either from general debility, excess iu veuerv, or a practice we cannot hold, in a moral point of view, in too much detestation.

    </li>
    <li id=7410 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Hence it is, that I contend we should always look to the proximate cause, as from the nature of this disease, each stage requires a distinct practice; and by attention to the nature of the discharge, this point will be fairly elucidated.

error : and am well convinced that was a decided practice adopted on the first commencement of those diseases we term chronic, much misery would be avoided, and many valuable lives saved.

      I know a suspicion of this kind is frequently entertained by patients; a suspicion that drives many to the empiric, who promises every thing, but performs nothing: this suspicion is as unfounded as the rest, and in a great measure, seconded by the nefarious practices of unprincipled drug venders, who, by the shameful adulteration of drugs, disappoint the hopes of the patient and practitioner, and thus contribute to diminish the confidence of the public; for the patient, tired of a tedious cure, flies to these empirics, who increase liis disorder, and his expences; nor are patients themselves exempt from blame ; for we too frequently find they desert one practitioner for another, and the last practitioner sometimes earns the laurels of the other; but more frequently the patient is made to suffer for his caprice ; little advantage is acquired in a captious change; but uo rule being without an exception, I cannot lay down a general plan; all I wish to impress on the mind of the patient is, that an unnecessary change of a medical attendant, is never to be recommended, and more particularly so, when labouring under this disease; for the generality of practitioners, essentially vary in their mode of practice, and the captious patient often has to lament, at the expence of his general health, the change; and another inducement patients have for deserting



the regular practitioner, is—llie cheap rate drugs are retailed at at many shops; these shops, it is true, may retail them at a cheaper rate; but the question that arises here, is, whether the drugs are genuine?

      jf a patient can submit to wear it nine or ten hours in a day, he will, in all probability, be much sooner relieved, and if it docs not stimulate too much by a constant application, it is certainly a prudent step to wear it night and day without intermission; but if that is not done, the patient had better only use it in the day-time.

    </li>
    <li id=7450 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Patients labouring under these diseases have reason to dread a return of them, but this in most cases may be prevented by having a supply of bougies in their possession.

    </li>
    <li id=7451 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The proper time to apply bougies is an hour or two before the usual time of rising m the morning.

    </li>
    <li id=7452 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The use of the bougie, when once



begun, should be persevered in for some time, nor should a failure in passing it at first deter the patient from persisting in the attempt; it may not be unnecessary to observe, that while an affection of the urethra continues, intemperance and high living must be avoided ; for when the corpus spongiosum urethrae is distended, the bougie will not operate so kindly.

    </li>
    <li id=7453 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      What renders these complaints so difficult of cure is, persons neglecting to apply in time; looking on its first commencement as proceeding from the stone or gravel, they content themselves with those remedies applicable to such cases, till at length, from excessive drinking, a long journey, or some similar cause, the obstacles are so far increased, as to bring on nearly a total suppression of urine ; the disorder is all this time permitted to gain ground, and the cure becomes more difficult ; whereas by an early application to some regular practitioner, the nature of the complaint would have before been discovered, and a proper mode of cure directed.

    </li>
    <li id=7454 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      It is now acknowledged that suppurative bougies answer every intention of cure in the diseases I speak of; and in proportion as the strictures are removed, the urine^ows freelj through the urethra, the callosities soften, and the fistulous openings show a good disposition to heal; mere dilatation in urethral strictures, will neither relieve the patient, nor promote the views of the surgeon ; a medicative power we must seek

e 2



for, capable of acting on Hie urethral membranes and mucal glands, so as to produce a good discharge.

    </li>
    <li id=7455 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      A question here naturally arises, do metallic bougies possess a medicative power ?

    </li>
    <li id=7456 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      no, they merely act by dilatation and abstraction, and I am led to conceive that passing and repassing over so delicate and irritable a surface as the inside of the urethra unquestionably is, a great disadvantage may arise from their application ; did metallic bougies possess galvanic power, what greater advantage would that principle give them over the plaster bougie, I confess myself ignorant of: an union of pewter, bismuth, and tin, are, in my opinion, of no real merit, as far as regards the removal of urethral strictures, arising from a venereal action.

    </li>
    <li id=7457 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The great error in the treatment of stricture appears to me to arise from supposing all strictures permanent, and which, I am convinced, is very rare ; while preternatural irritability occasioning spasm, is not an uncommon cause of stricture.

    </li>
    <li id=7458 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      ^ hen I speak of temporary stricture, I mean the whole urethra is^fected by one spasm; and, I believe, the use of caustic has induced a permanent stricture, where only a temporary stricture first existed.

    </li>
    <li id=7459 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Spasm is a common disease of every part of the urethra, and which the precipitate use of any bougie may induce to an uncommon degree; nor is the



disposition to spasm greater in one part than the other.

    </li>
    <li id=7460 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Gonorrhoea, by producing a high state of irritation, maybe productive of it; want of patience in the introduction of the bougie, in such cases, may be the ground of very serious injury; and, 1 believe, rash treatment has been the cause of more permanent strictures than any disposition in those parts.

    </li>
    <li id=7461 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      I am well convinced bougies are frequently employed when no necessity exists for their introduction, and that spasm is the consequence; which induces a belief of the existence of real stricture, although the urine has been accustomed to pass freely ; and, I certainly think, that if the urine flows in a fair, moderate stream, no surgical assistance is required ; and when it is required, the cure must not be left solely to its operation, the bougie may remove preternatural contraction, but not the cause of the disease.

    </li>
    <li id=7462 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      This will require camphor, opium, aether, and mercury, where venereal excitement is the predisposing cause.

    </li>
    <li id=7463 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      There is also another very material error in the treatment of these diseases : if different constitutions, labouring under the same disease, require different forms of medicine, I think we should accelerate the cure of urethral complaint by varying the composition of the bougie, as circumstances indicated: it is this want of variation that renders these cases tedious and incomplete.

    </li>
    <li id=7464 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      My principal view in this depart-



merit is to recommend&#39;to those afflicted with stricture, and generally those affections of the bladder and urethra, which are the consequence of ill-treated cases of clap, a bougie, where necessary, that shall combine in itself a mild and efficacious remedy, as far as depends upon local means.

    </li>
    <li id=7465 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      On the composition and qualities of bougies, the chief circumstances that are to be dreaded, and which prove too often fatal, are the morbid effects of it, which attack the passage of the urethra, and impede the discharge of urine.

    </li>
    <li id=7466 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Many have been induced to believe, that in consequence of mattter or pus covering the end of the bougie, when withdrawn, that the whole urethra was ulcerated ; which has no foundation in fact, being merely the effect of a stimulus applied to so delicate a membrane.

    </li>
    <li id=7467 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      A medical gentleman, with wonderful sagacity, has found the abstraction of this matter to be necessary to the cure of the Tabes Dorsalis, &amp;c.

    <li id=7469 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The foundation of the most serious evil is laid from this source, for the bladder becomes harassed and worn out by the unavoidable and fruitless attempts to void the urine: disease of course attacks its internal structure; its power as a circular muscle, acting by its own irritability, becomes weakened, is often entirely lost, and the unhappy patient hardly enjoys an hour ot ease or tranquillity, from the very distressing sen-



sations connected with this state.

    </li>
    <li id=7470 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      To remove these, local, and constitutional means are both requsit&#39;e, and the bougie forms a prominent character in their cure; hut hitherto the nature of the bougie has been little understood, and its application accordingly made in an improper manner : the question is, whether this useful instrument should act entirely on mechanical principles, or should combine with this, a sanative operation ?

    </li>
    <li id=7471 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      If we examine the natural structure of the parts to which it is applied, we find them endued with an exquisite sensibility, and in case of stricture this sensibility is increased to a morbid, and often painful degree, not unfre-quently accompanied with actual inflammation.

    </li>
    <li id=7472 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The introduction, then, of any mechanical substance into a part in this state, cannot fail to promote preternatural irritation, and to heighten every painful .

      symptom which attends the disease nor is this all that is necessary to effect a cure.

    </li>
    <li id=7474 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The bougie, even if it acts mechanically, it is only necessary it should do so on that part where the stricture or obstruction is situated: the bougie ought invariably to be

introduced in the form of the catheter, otherwise a rupture of the canal of the urethra will take place.

    </li>
    <li id=7475 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      A small bougie ought never to be passed, when the urethra will admit a larger.

    </li>
    <li id=7476 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The first idea of the bougie seems to have been wrong, as the means of applying medicine to the obstructed



part: and corresponding to this idea, the instrument was generally smeared with irritating or caustic applications for this purpose, on the [trine i-ple of destroying it.

    </li>
    <li id=7477 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The attention Mr. Daran paid to this department, brought the bougie into greater perfection, and the use of it into general practice.

    </li>
    <li id=7478 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      His improvement consisted in introducing into it ingredients of an irritating nature, but so blended as to be less active than the others of his dav: he

likewise gave it a smoothness and a firmness of surface, to which hitherto little attention had been paid.

    </li>
    <li id=7480 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      But in the composition of the bougie Mr. Daran proceeded on a false supposition : he conceived suppuration, or discharge of matter from the urethra, was necessary to the cure of stricture; and the business of the destruction of this morbid enlargement took place by the suppurative process alone.

    </li>
    <li id=7481 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      There is little doubt that the success of his means depended much on the mechanical action of the instrument on the morbid part; and that the irritation that it produced elsewhere, so far from being serviceable, was exciting unnecessary uneasiness, weakening the constitution by a profuse discharge, and in other respects operating prejudicially to the patient.

    </li>
    <li id=7482 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      But so much did he conceive his cures as connected with the medicated qualities of his instrument, that he concealed its composition.

    </li>
    <li id=7483 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      But though Daran made a wrong application of the medicated quali-



ties of bis bougie.

    </li>
    <li id=7484 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      , still I mean not to infer that (he medicated quality is not one of the most essential requisites to the cure.

    </li>
    <li id=7485 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      In making these bougies, attention should be paid to all the requisites in point of shape and form.

    </li>
    <li id=7486 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Certain it is, that to Daran we owe the formation of a bougie, founded on regular and scientific principles.

    </li>
    <li id=7487 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      In the use of the bougie, we ought to consider what is our object in its application: do we want to allay spasm, or remove obstruction ?

    </li>
    <li id=7488 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      because these circumstances require a variation in the composition; and this want of variation, I am led to conceive, renders the cure tedious and incomplete ; in the first we want a bougie to assist our internal medicine, in abating the spasm, while in the latter we want a bougie that will promote the general circulation, dispose the parts to a salutary, inflammatory action, and the formation of good pus, with a disposition to heal.

    </li>
    <li id=7489 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The bougies that would be proper to these stages again answers not our intention in gleets of long duration, where an anodyne quality appears necessary.

    </li>
    <li id=7490 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The strongest objections to the caustic bougie, I conceive to be in the rapidity of its action, and the uncertainty of its application : for by exposing the membranes of the cells of the penis, to such a violent and extended process of sloughing, as not only to threaten, by a frequent repetition, arterial hemorrhage, but total destruction to the



circular lining of the urethra; hence it is the frequent application I condemn more than its use, for the abuse arises rather from that source, than in the caustic itself.

    </li>
    <li id=7491 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      I conceive all haemorrhage detrimental to our object in these cases; and when produced invariably retards it: again the superiority of the common bougie over the armed is marked ; for we generally can introduce the common bougie without haemorrhage, while the armed usually produces it; but I never saw overflowing chamber-pots of blood from its use, though the urethra will admit very frequently of a force, we could not suppose it capable of bearing ; yet I conceive that no apology for its application—for by the exercise of our patience, we shall procure the dilatation; force may overcome, but cannot ultimately relieve ; experience alone will decide the necessary quantum we want.

      Two causes, hitherto claiming little attention, very materially retard the introduction of the bougie, by increasing the local irritation&#39;: costiveness has a peculiar tendency to this, and which ought always to be avoided, when you mean to have the instrument passed ; the making water a few minutes before its introduction, increases the spasm, and of course retards its passing: these causes lead me



to suppose that the resistance arising from them,

• has been mistaken for strictures, particularly where the spasm has been so great as to leave an indentation ; and this indentation, unfortunately for suffering&#39; humanity, has left no doubt on the mmd of the practitioner, ot the actual existence o( permanent stricture : apply caustic to such a state of the urethra, its effects are too obvious to require comment.

      As we are on practical observations, I shall mention how far the patient ought to pass the bougie, which ought never to be but just beyond the strictures, and the patient’s feelings will be bis best criterion to judge when he has passed them; por should the bougie, even by the surgeon, be passed often into the bladder, for when we have ascertained the nature of the case, what have we to do with the bladder by local application ?

      Sharp, an author of considerable experience, and whose judgment demands accurate attention, says, “ it is yery remarkable in regard to many of these strictures, that the symptoms arising from them shall be extenuated by acting against the stricture, that is to say, by introducing a bougie big enough to distend the urethra, the pain of the stricture shall cease, and the stranguary abate ; so that a man accustomed to make water every hour, shall, by wearing a bougie, retain it three or four hours.”

      Suppression of urine, as connected with this state of the disease, arises more from inflammation or spasm, than actual obstruction ; the means adopted for relief must be by bleeding, glvster, and a cooling diet, with a liberal use of opium ; immerging the feet into cold water has frequently relieved the spasm; but where connected with much inflammation, the warm bath is most to be.

    <li id=7548 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      In another part of his work, Mr. Abernethy thus reasons: “ It follows as a general rule of conduct

in practice, that surgeons are not to confide in their powers of discrimination ; but in all cases of ulcers, arising from impure intercourse, to act as if the sore was venereal, to give sufficient mercury slightly to affect the constitution; to guard against the consequences of absorption, and by local and general means to cure as quickly as possible the local disease, and thus remove the source of contamination, and the necessity for the continuance of the medicine.

to modify the action of the mercury, so that while it operates specifically in the removal of the virus, the constitution shall not suffer ; by this mode of action, where previous infection really existed, a practitioner cannot fall into gross and fundamental error; while, on the other hand, should any latent spark really remain behind, and the case treated by any other remedy, or the disease permitted to exhaust itself, the practitioner will soon be convinced he has fallen into a gross and fundamental error: the bad elFect of such a doctrine is too apparent to require any comments.

      Under these distressing circumstances, a patient ought to lose no time in applying for advice ; for dreadful exulceration of the hone, w hen once commenced, not only reduces the bone it attacks to a



mere mass of mouldering corruption, but threatens the whole frame; thus inducing, in the active bloom of life, all the decrepitude of old age: for, not satisfied with extending its most distressing symptoms to the bones, it attacks the nerves in their several ramifications, the periosteum, medullary substance, and the adjoining tendons of the muscles; consequently the pain must be bevoud description.

      The great importance of this firm, hut flexible union of bones must be obvious ; hence when inflammation takes place, the pain must be beyond description; its first symptoms area sensation of constant gnawing in the bone, as it it was bruised and grinding; and in the musculary parts as it torn away.

      The mercury should be thrown in by unction, and particularly from the neighbourhood of the skin, or surface where the swelling is situated, in order that the medicine may pass directly through the swelling.

    </li>
    <li id=7736 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      On the swelling itself, the mercurial plaster, as formerly recommended in bubo, or in place of it, the mercurial plaster with guin ammoniac, may be applied.

power to check its progress, then ulcers form in the parts described, as attacked by the infection, and these ulcers are combined wi&#39;h peculiar circumstances, either from their situation and the texture of the parts they occupy, or from a fault in the patient’s constitution, which renders them difficult to cure.

    </li>
    <li id=7740 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Such ulcers have their sides and bottoms, of a dirty brown appearance, with a fetid acrid discharge, often of a green colour ; and this state of the part cannot be changed by any outward application alone.

      Vr here the situation of this ulcer is on the part occupied by a blotch, or previous eruption, it gives little pain, but it gradually deepens till it reaches the bone; and if it continue long, a probe may be even passed into the bone ; where the ulcer is situated over a bone, and is the consequence of its swelling, it is more painful, and its cure is much more tedious than the former.

    </li>

bone of the nose ; and from the very delicate structure of the parts, their progress here is very rapid.

    </li>
    <li id=7745 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The whole palate will be often destroyed in a week, and the thin plates of bone within the nose, so soon as they become affected, very quickly lose the principle of life, and before a cure can be effected, they must separate or be thrown off, which is often attended with the most hideous deformity to the patient, and indeed he may be very thankful if he does not lose his life.

    </li>
    <li id=7746 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      This ulcer is always attended with the most offensive discharge, which renders it one of the most serious symptoms of the disease.

    </li>
    <li id=7747 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The treatment of all the ulcers in this very advanced stage of the disease, requires much perseverance in the use of mercury, and at the same time to regulate it by what the constitution of the patient can bear.

    </li>
    <li id=7748 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      It will be sometimes necessary to give up the course entirely, to put the patient on a bracing plan, and then to begin it anew; along with the mercury it will also be requisite to use every other means that can assist.

    </li>
    <li id=7749 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Thus, the warm bath will be often useful, in order to allow the mercury to accumulate in the body, and to take off symptoms of irritation.

    </li>
    <li id=7750 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The long continued harassing pain from the disease, must be allayed by a proper use of opium; and the weakness and loss of tone which the medicine may produce, are to be got the better of, •or prevented going too far, by the bark, steel,

      The mercurial action must be&#39;produced as quickly as possible, and persevered in unremittingly, till the progress of the ulceration appears checked; it may then be continued more slow ly, but should not be given up for a great length of time, till all danger of a relapse is past.

      The following Cases are merely given to shew the necessity of a strict attention on the part of the patient, to the means recommended for his cure: for I am certain that many of the cases I daily see, arise more from inattention on the part of the patient, than from any other cause, who too frequently thinks himself well, when only the disease is just beginning to subside.

      *The cases of stricture are given to prove the necessity of a bougie, possessing a medical, as w ell as a mechanical action; nevertheless the bougie is not solely to be relied upon; for stricture arising from venereal action, you must combine with it the alterative plan.

      Stricture is often a constitutional disease, to which every passage of the body is liable lined with a secreting membrane; for this disposition to stricture is equally conspicuous in certain persons, as a tendency to warts and other excrescences of the skin ; but that it more frequently is brought on by the excitement of general irritation, is not less obvious: nine hundred and ninety nine out of

a thousand cases, however, of stricture arise from venereal excitement, and where the contrary is actually the case, there must be a strong constitutional disposition to produce it; and when thus produced, a relapse is nearly certain.

found my fears but too well grounded.

      Perceiving that he seemed resohed to continue the use of it, after submitting to it for a few weeks, I discontinued going to that gentleman, as the pain was so violent during, and after, introduction, that I firmly made up my mind, whatever might be the consequence, never to undergo a similar operation.

    </li>
    <li id=7795 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The unfortunate result of my applicat ion deterred me for a long time from consulting any other medical gentleman ; the complaint of course increased, and became troublesome.

      It is now about six weeks since, that finding all the unpleasant svmptoms considerably increased, I again applied to my friend, who found three strictures, all extremely contracted; one particularly, so as to admit with the utmost trouble, a bougie of nearly the smallest



size.

    </li>
    <li id=7801 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      I have been to him eight or ten times, but as he renews bis suggestion as to the propriety of using kali purum, and that I am determined not to suffer any caustic to be again introduced, I have made up my mind to avail myself of the assistance of some gentleman who does not use the caustic.

      I have a wife and children, and no man can be more blessed in the domestic state than I am; indeed I love my wife more, probably, than I ought, considering my complaint; but this is the only excess that I commit, as, in point of diet, no man can be more rigidly abstinent than I am.

    <li id=7806 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      I have given these cases because they are recent, in preference to those long since cured ; and more particularly to show that after the fair trials the armed bougies have had, they really fall short of the eulogium they have received.

    </li>
    <li id=7807 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      In both these cases they did injury ; the first was an actual case of stricture, the second a spasmodic one ; for the bougie in this patient was introduced with great pain, but fortunately without hemorrhage ; whereas iu



cases of actual stricture, the bougie invariably passes with great facility till it comes in contact with the stricture.

    </li>
    <li id=7808 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The bougie I fir§t intioduced in this case, was one ol a moderate size ; in the application of all bougies care must be used ; indeed no patient ought to introduce it him sell, and when they do, care should be taken to bend the bougie, so that it may take the curve of the urethra.

    </li>
    <li id=7809 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      I his is necessary in the application of every kind of bougie, but more particularly in the use ol the metallic ones, when under the influence of a mercurial course, as the inventor affirms the least touch of the mercury will make the bougie brittle, and liable to break.

    </li>
    <li id=7810 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The influence mercury possesses on these bougies, renders them inadmissible in almost cveiy case of stricture; as I am well convinced few cases will yield only to the use of the bougie, we want something more than a mere wedge.

    </li>
    <li id=7811 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      These bougies produce an increased secretion—-it is by their act of stimuli, which any extraneous body will produce, and what power a galvanic principle possesses in urethral cases, I must confess I am ignorant of.

    </li>
    <li id=7812 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      I maintain the primary cause of stricture is venereal excitement in the generality of cases ; therefore to get rid of the primary and secondary causes, mercury is absolutely necessary ; how, under these circumstanees, a metallic bougie is with confidence to be applied, I know not: such speculative reasoning, however high the authority that accom-



pariies it, will never make me desert the opinion I have formed from fact and analogy.

    </li>
    <li id=7813 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      In one class of stricture alone do I admit of their use; that is, in constitutional, stricture, where we only want, in fact, mere dilatation, a suppurative action militating against the cure.

      Sir— hen I had last the pleasure of seeing you in London, and bought the bougies, I was mentioning to you, how ill I had been in my complaint the beginning of the year; and you were so kind to say, if I would let you know in what manner I was affected, you would assist me with your advice : you were mentioning that I ought to keep the bougies in five or six hours at a time.

      I am one of those unfortunate people who have suffered from that pernicious habit of Onanism, which I see you notice in the Appendix.

      It is upwards of six years since the bad effects were first produced; at that time they rather assumed a serious appearance, but by the assistance of bark and sea-bathing they were so far removed, that for the last four years I have enjoyed



a tolerable, though by no means a good state of health.

    </li>
    <li id=7877 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Before stating what my complaints are, it will be proper to inform you that I am twenty-five years of age, of a tall and thin habit of body; the latter has been not a little increased by my complaints.

    </li>
    <li id=7878 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      My profession is sedentary, being a good deal employed in writing.

    </li>
    <li id=7879 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      As I said above, for some years my health has been tolerable, though very far from good, and of late I think it has been getting worse.

    </li>
    <li id=7880 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The first cause of the complaint has, as much as lies in my power, been removed ; but the bad effects in various ways still continue.

    </li>
    <li id=7881 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      I have been, and still am, very subject to nocturnal emissions, which continue and still increase my complaints.

    </li>
    <li id=7882 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      These happen at times two or three times a week, and at others not for fourteen days; but never have left me.

    <li id=7883 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The consequence is, as you easily understand, that the parts are very much debilitated ; and I am afraid, in addition, that one of my testicles (the left) is not in a sound state.

      Complaints in my stomach and bowels are what principally torment me, and these, I think, always proceed from flatulency and bile, and generally attended with costiveness.

    </li>
    <li id=7886 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Of the latter I pass at times considerable quantities; after which,in general, my bowels seem so far eased, though always a good deal of uneasiness remains.

plaint seems to have so much increased as once or twice to produce vomiting and purging both at the same time : perhaps for this there might be another cause, but the principal, is certainly the weakness and irritation of my stomach.

      I think the most part of my complaints I have mentioned.

      You will perceive there is a good deal of what is called nervous, though I do not think any very serious complaint is yet formed ; yet certainly the unpleasantness of what I have, renders them sufficiently so.

      I have consulted a surgeon of no little eminence, and l)v his directions took considerable quantities of bark, and various other things, but nothing he prescribed seemed to have any effect: indeed T did not think he viewed matters exactly in that serious light I could have wished.

      To Dr. Cciton,

Sir —A gentleman, a friend of mine (a married man), having seen your publication recommending medicated bougies in disorders of the urethra, labours under a complaint of that kind, and has desired me to address you on the subject.

    </li>
    <li id=7898 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      His symptoms are thus described by him : when he has a desire of making water it does not flow in a full and copious stream, unless retarded by stopping it till the passage is full, but runs off in a small diminished stream, and if the skin is drawn back, divided into two small ones.

    </li>
    <li id=7899 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Previous to the desire of passing his urine, a quickness or sharpness of sensation, at times amounting to pain, is felt about the glans, where he thinks much of&#39;the disorder lies, attended sometimes with a forcing pain, which extends to the fundament.

    </li>
    <li id=7900 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      He was accustomed to live rather free, though a sober man, but this complaint has obliged him to confine himself altogether to water at his principal meals, for some time past; having suffered twice by drinking too treely, not



being able to pass any urine for several hours, by a dreadful strangury.

    </li>
    <li id=7901 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      He also says, lie is very sensible of a painful obstruction in the moment of emission, which always increases the difficulty and heat of passing urine the following day.

    </li>
    <li id=7902 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      He constantly observes something like small threads swimming in the urine.

    </li>
    <li id=7903 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      This disorder, he believes, was first brought on by taking calomel pills, as they were represented to him to be, too soon, in a venereal infection, which, though it cured him, laid the foundation of this complaint.

    </li>
    <li id=7904 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      When he first discovered it, being at that time unattended to, and in the way of seeing much company, neglected it, he was informed by many of his friends it was the gravel.

    </li>
    <li id=7905 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      He has no soreness or pain whatever outwardly, and in every other respect enjoys remarkable good health.

    </li>
    <li id=7906 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      For obvious reasons he himself has declined addressing you; you will, therefore.

      Sir — I am now in my 34th year, of naturally a good constitution, and rather given to be lusty, and in some measure inclined to a grossness, which nothing but change of air and exercise removes.

    </li>
    <li id=7910 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The last seven years, and more particularly the lat-



ter part of this period, I have been closely confined to the desk; but during last summer, from April (when the warm weather first commenced) until I went to the sea in August, I was severely ill, owing partly to that close attention which I paid to business, and partly from being unable to change the air, and recruit the strength spent in that attention, my illness fell very much upon my nerves, and I still feel the effects of it.

    </li>
    <li id=7911 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      I have likewise been, and am much afflicted with a scrofulous complaint, which I took from a wet nurse by whom I was brought up, which is a constant source of uneasiness, and, I have no doubt, tends to diminish my strength in some respect.

    </li>
    <li id=7912 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      This humour is constantly breaking out upon the skin, which of course in some measure relieves it, and I am advised to have an issue for it, which may probably render it weaker, and thus strengthen and clear the constitution.

    </li>
    <li id=7913 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      But I feel more waste of strength from a degree of seminal weakness, which I have for some time laboured under, than from perhaps all the other causes put together.

    </li>
    <li id=7914 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      It generally happens involuntarily, in the course of the night, about, upon an average, every tenth day, sometimes once in a fortnight, sometimes once in a week, which I conceived might have occurred from the circumstance of the weather having been more bracing at one time than another; and from having perhaps lived a little



better some few days than others; and it seemed to me that when a certain quantity of semen had collected, it discharged itself, as before stated, perfectly involuntarily during sleep.

    </li>
    <li id=7915 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      It is also attended with a total weakness and want of power in the parts, particularly in the penis, which, for the purposes of generation, feels ineffectual, and before a connection with the other sex, discharges the semen without any of the strength and force necessary for the purposes above stated.

    </li>
    <li id=7916 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      How this was originally brought on, I cannot precisely say.

    </li>
    <li id=7917 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      W hether by means of the complaint I have stated, or from the indiscretion of younger days, or from the effects oi my constitution having been weakened of later years, and it may have occurred from a species of all.

    </li>
    <li id=7918 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      I therefore w&#39;ish the case to be seriously considered, in order to get it remedied if possible.

    </li>
    <li id=7919 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      I need not say that I do not wish names to be mentioned, that I wish the matter to be as private as possible, and that it may be considered without personal examination.

    </li>
    <li id=7920 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      I must also observe that I am naturally very liable to colds in the head, which affect me very much all over, and to a head-ache, which comes on with the evening, when I work, as I generally do, pretty closely ; and, as I conceive, arises very much from my nerves.

    </li>
    <li id=7921 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      I have a good appetite, but not very good digestion; I breakfast at nine, dine at four, seldom take



any thing between those hours, take tea at halt past six, and sometimes a crust ot bread, or something of that kind for supper.

    </li>
    <li id=7922 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      I usually have a glass of port wine every day after dinner, and in fact live regularly, and pretty well.

    </li>
    <li id=7923 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      I am not the least inclined to drink, nor have I suffered any thing from disease but what you • have been acquainted with, which was veiy trifling, but sufficient to make me rigidly caieful of a connection with women of the town.

    <li id=7924 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      However, as I look forward, as most others do, to be settled comfortably in life, it is necessary, e\en upon this account, that I should be in possession of all those powers nature endowed me with, but which I certainly do not now possess.

      I am not aware that I need say any thing more than that if medicine is necessary (as 1 presume it beyond all question is ) I wish it to be made up in pills, being most convenient to be taken , and I hope it will not require any peculiar restraint ot diet or any thing else, which will have the effect of putting me out of the regular course I now
