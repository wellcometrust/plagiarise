      The following chapters have been written for tlie purpose of imparting some little information on subjects of the greatest importance.

      The friglitful ravages of Spermatorrhoea, and the dire effects of Syphilis, are matters which must almost alarm the calm impartial observer.

      ISTor have I succumbed to that false prudery TY-hich is so prevalent in society: I have disregarded it because I believe it to be mischievous and to have no connection ^\&#39;ith real, genuine modesty.

    </li>
    <li id=4481 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      I have told plain facts, and those who affect to be shocked at them will only remind me of the young lady whose modesty was so great that she could not look at the noticed truth.

      My aim is a good one : if men misinterpret my motive I cannot help it, nor do I care for what they may say.

    </li>
    <li id=4492 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Shall we not rather, despite false delicacy, investigate the origin and causes of such diseases, and endeavor to determine the true pnnciples of their cure ?

      Tliis term spermatorrhcea is derived from two Greek Avords, signifying a flowing of seed, and is applied to all cases in Avhioh an



emission of tlie seed takes place, excepting from coition ; in other Avords, spermatorrlia&#39;a may be termed an involnntary loss of the semen.

      The symptoms of spermatorrhoea may be divided into local and constitutional.

      The local sym])-toms are generally emissions of seed at night; and we call the particular attention of our readers to this rule.

      During the progress of spermatorrhea many patients suffer from a hard dry cough, a difficulty of breathing, pains in the chest, and hence are treated for consumption ; for the constitutional symptoms of spermatorrhoea are innumerable, and when the cause of disease is unknown and unsuspected, the general practitioner will naturally attack the symptoms.

      We all know that for many years the remedies generally relied on in these cases were arsenic, mercury (corrosive sublimate), antimony, and caustic ; that medical men looked upon skin diseases in general (as too many, indeed, continue to do) as something to be hammered at, without much hope of relief, with all tlie most deadly drugs of the Pharmacopoeia.
