      It were needless to expatiate more upon the dangers peculiar to masturbation; they are but too real, and too well demonstrated.

      This destructive habit, as the most frequent cause of impotency and sterility, claims our first consideration.

      It may be defined, the discharge of the semen from a preternatural stimulus; the habit, it is said, of the solitary monk and recluse, as well as of inconsiderate youth, and of those whose riper years, it might naturally be expected and hoped, would prevent their guilty indulgence in an offence so severely denounced in the Scriptures, and in itself so revolting to every sentiment of manhood.

    </li>
    <li id=6241 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      It is a practice of the most destructive tendency, pregnant with mental and physical evils, notwithstanding the assertions that have been made to the contrary by some authors.

    </li>
    <li id=6242 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The concurrent testimonies of all writers on the subject (with the exception just alluded to) amply illustrate its baneful consequences.

    <li id=6243 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Hippocrates, in his works, notices it: Celsus also, in his book on the Preservation of Health, remarks, &quot;These habits are always hurtful to weak people, and the frequent indulgence in them weakens those of the strongest constitution.&quot;

      Aetius gives a dreadful picture of their evils:—&quot;Young people (says he) have the air and appearance of old age; they become pale, effeminate, lazy, benumbed, base, stupid, and even imbecile; they have an utter distaste for everything, are totally incapacited, and many become paralytic&quot; Galen, also, mentions similar evils as resulting from this destructive habit.

      I have seen (he continues) a patient whose disorder began by lassitude, and a weakness in all parts of the body, particularly towards the loins; it was attended with an involuntary motion of the tendons, periodical spasms, and bodily decay, insomuch as to destroy the whole corporeal frame.&quot;

      Another powerful inducement to its practice is the secrecy and apparent impunity with which it may be indulged in, and there we find the fruitful source of its gigantic evil—the continued repetition of the act; but those who think thus should recollect that there is a Supreme Being, from whose searching eye nothing is concealed—nay, we also tell them, that even to the eye of man shall their guilt and shame be revealed, by their sunken countenances, lusterless eyes, and attenuated frames.

PRACTICE, AND OBSERVATIONS



ON THE ABUSE OF MERCURY.

    </li>
    <li id=6282 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The ravages and miseries this class of diseases have caused in every part of the world is too well known to require our entering into a minute detail, but, unfortunately, many do not give the subject any consideration, but rush headlong into all kinds of excesses, unmindful of the direful consequences which are too often the results upon the health, the reproductive functions, and on life itself.

    </li>
    <li id=6283 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Cases are daily submitted to our attention showing the rapid inroads these diseases make upon the constitution, when unchecked or injudiciously treated; for a variety of obstacles and difficulties present them





It is impossible to imagine what sufferings may be entailed, by the parent on the offspring, if the system is not thoroughly purified; at the same time causing the unhappiness of her with whom he has linked his fate.

    </li>
    <li id=6284 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      There have been instances in our practice of persons with gonorrhoea who have thought themselves cured, having merely a thin watery discharge from the urethra (and that very slightly,) infecting his wife, thus creating a catalogue of woes in his domestic circle, begetting children who inherit the germ of disease from the parent.

    </li>
    <li id=6285 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Instances could be quoted of women giving birth to six or eight infants in rapid succession, born dead and decomposed, in consequence of ill cured syphilis in the father; it is, therefore, highly criminal for any man to marry, if the system is not completely purified of infection—for if this is not observed, and if he even has children, they are very likely to come into the world a spectacle to all beholders, subject to the evil and eruptions of the most inveterate tendency; thus many families inherit various maladies arising from impure blood, scrofulous or venereal taint, assuming so many appearances that the greatest discrimination is necessary to detect its presence,—at one time affecting the skin, particularly the





head and face, with eruptions and ulcers; at another period producing the most violent pains in the limbs and bones, which is frequently mistaken for rheumatism; thus the whole frame becomes debilitated and decays, and a lingering death puts a period to their dreadful sufferings.

    </li>
    <li id=6286 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Notwithstanding the improvement in the mode of treating this malady, it is a disorder of so penetrating and malignant a nature, that it is requisite to watch it through all its stages with the utmost attention; the insidious and pernicious influence of the venereal virus must be counteracted with prompitude by efficient medicines, that will lead to those results so much to be desired, without endangering the constitution.

    </li>
    <li id=6287 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      It is no reflection on the knowledge or judgement of the members of the profession in general to say, they have very seldom an opportunity of having that experience in diseases arising from venereal excesses, or originating in disorganization of the reproductive organs, in consequence of their attention being drawn to the numerous diseases the human frame is incident to.

    </li>
    <li id=6288 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Neither do we arrogate to ourselves superior endowments by stating that, in consequence of an extensive practice of many years in a particular branch of the profession, we are enabled to offer to those requiring our aid the advantages we have obtained by practical knowledge of these diseases.

    </li>
    <li id=6289 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Without any more preface we shall now enter more minutely into a description of the different form syphilis assumes, in as concise, clear, and intelligible manner as possible.

    </li>
    <li id=6290 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The Venereal Disease may be divided into different classes, according to the appearances it assumes afte sexual intercourse; for instance, Gonorrhoea ;—an inflammation of the Urethra, producing a discharge of a white, yellow, or green matter.

    </li>
    <li id=6291 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      —A peculiar ulcer, seated on the glans, prepuce, or body of the penis, is called a chancre.

    </li>
    <li id=6292 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      —A swelling of the groin bubo, and the more serious cases arising from the latter are called Secondary Symptoms.

    </li>
    <li id=6293 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      GONORRHCEA.

    </li>
    <li id=6294 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      A person may be infected with Gonorrhoea, the third or sixth day after impure connexion; but sometimes it does not appear until the expiration of ten or fifteen days.

    </li>
    <li id=6295 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      —At the onset, a sense of heat, or itching is experienced in the orifice of the urethra;—in the course of a day or two, this sensation becomes intolerable, —particularly when voiding urine, when a burning heat is experienced;—inflammation takes place; and, if not speedily subdued at the commencement may extend along the whole of the tube to the bladder.

    </li>
    <li id=6296 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The stream of urine is then observed to be diminished in size; instead of passing in one continual stream, it becomes forked—is voided with the greatest difficulty in very small quantities; a slight white, yellow, or green discharge issues from the urethra, accompanied by painful erections of the penis, when the patient gets warm in bed.

    </li>
    <li id=6297 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      If, from false delicacy, or any other cause the person neglects to have proper advice, all those symptoms soon become aggravated; pains are experienced in the groiu, .

    </li>
    <li id=6298 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      testicles or scrotum, and very much increased





on evacuating the bladder or bowels.

    </li>
    <li id=6299 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Now the discharge is increased—it stains the linen ;—a frequent desire is felt to make water, and which is not passed without the most excruciating burning pain; the glans penis becomes swollen, the testicles are painful, and sometimes so sensitive as to require a suspensory bandage to support them.

    </li>
    <li id=6300 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The erections of the penis become constant,—particularly at night—very painful, and curved,—constituting what is termed a chordee.

    </li>
    <li id=6301 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Sometimes by improper treatment, or persons tampering with themselves, the discharge ceases suddenly, or is very slight, without the inflammation being subdued; then one, or both testicles become swollen, extremely painful and inflamed, causing frequently disorganization of the reproductive powers, and incurable sterility and impotency.

    </li>
    <li id=6302 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Sometimes inflammation of the prepuce or foreskin ensues, so that it cannot be drawn back; the disease is then termed Phymosis.

    </li>
    <li id=6303 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Then again the prepuce may become contracted by inflammation,—is drawn back for some purpose or another, is called Paraphymosis.

    </li>
    <li id=6304 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      If this is not quickly remedied, the inflammation is considerably increased—sloughing of both the glans and the prepuce follows; but if immediate attention is paid to the case, and it is judiciously treated, this alarming state may be easily cured ; but where adhesion has taken place, or ulceration exists, it will be more difficult to subdue; the adhesions must be seperated, orthe stricture divided with the scalpel.

    </li>
    <li id=6305 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Instances have occurred in the course of our practice, in cases of Phymosis and Puraplrymosis, where sloughing and ulceration have taken place through neglect, and more or less destruction of the penis followed.

    </li>
    <li id=6306 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      We, therefore, wish to impress on our readers the neceessity of the utmost attention, prompitude, and care, to prevent the most serious consequences following in cases of this kind.

    </li>
    <li id=6307 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The Purifying Vegetable Fills are the most safe and certain remedy, and if taken according to the directions a speedy and sure cure will be effected without the slightest fear of the disorder returning, provided the patient continues to take them some little time after all symptoms have disappeared.

    </li>
    <li id=6308 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The efficacy of the Purifying Vegetable Pills are too well known to require comment, but it will not he out of place here to state, they having been used with every success during our extensive practice we can with every pleasure and confidence recommend them, the more particularly as they require no restraint to the man of business or pleasure, and will prevent the fatal consequences hourly arising from the unskilful treatment of Practitioners generally.

    </li>
    <li id=6309 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      .

    </li>
    <li id=6310 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      One of the results of an ill-cured gonorrhoea is a thin watery discharge from the urethra, termed gleet.

    </li>
    <li id=6311 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Intemperance increases the discharge, and if continued, and the patient neglects to have the disease removed, the constant waste will exhaust his strength, and eventually destroy the bodily faculties.

    </li>
    <li id=6312 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Stricture of the urethra may also arise from a long continued gleet.

    </li>
    <li id=6313 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The medicines that are salutary in these cases are those that have a direct influence on the mucous membranes; namely the Cordial Balm Of Zbylanica and Purifying Vegetable Pills.

    </li>
    <li id=6314 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      When gleet arises from gonorrhoea, it is necessary the patient should be





aware that the disease may be conveyed to another in the act of coition.

    </li>
    <li id=6315 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      A gleet sometimes arises from other causes—it may originate from nervous debility or seminal weakness, brought on by that solitary and pernicious habit, Onanism, or it may be symptomatic of a diseased prostrate gland or stricture.

    </li>
    <li id=6316 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Another evil that may arise during the progress of Gonorrhoea is an enlargement of the glands of one or both groins; these are termed Sympathetic Buboes &gt; and are very different from those appearing after chancre.

    </li>
    <li id=6317 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      A gonorrhceal bubo is of little consequence, if judiciously treated.

    </li>
    <li id=6318 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The absolute necessity of proper advice in those cases must be very evident; for the ignorant pretender may easily mistake a syphilitic for a gonorrhceal bubo, each requiring very opposite treatment.

    </li>
    <li id=6319 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      It is most essential that cleanliness should be observed during the progress of Gonorrhoea, washing the parts frequently with warm water: for the discharge is so acrimonious, that it will fret the skin, if allowed to accumulate; and frequent ablutions assist very much in subduing the inflammation, and preventing the results of phymosis or paraphymosis, which have been already described.

    </li>
    <li id=6320 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      In the first stages of the disease, the diet should be mild and nutritious, avoiding higly-seasoned dishes, and every thing that will excite or increase inflammation; therefore wines and spirituous liquors should be refrained from: much benefit will be experienced from the use of linseed tea, barley-water, other mucilaginous drinks, as they diminish the acrimony of the urine, and render it less stimulating to the inflamed urethra ,





however, when the inflammation is subdued, there will not be that necessity for a strict observance in regard of diet; yet temperance must be observed, and excess of every kind avoided; for the cure will be retarded, and the symptoms aggravated, by sensual indulgences of every description.

    </li>
    <li id=6321 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      STRICTURE.

    </li>
    <li id=6322 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Stricture of the Urethra is often caused by unskilful treatment of gonorrhoea, masturbation, long retention of urine, sedentary habits, excessive indulgence of the passions.

    </li>
    <li id=6323 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      When the orifice of the urethra is contracted by structural disorganization, it is termed permanent; when by some spasmodic contraction, it is temporary.

    </li>
    <li id=6324 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Spasmodic Stricture very frequently arises from Gleet or Gonorrhoea imperfectly or only partially cured.

    </li>
    <li id=6325 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The young man fancying himself nearly well is tempted to join his companions in some carousal; the conviviality of the evening, the hilarity of the party, leads him on from glass to glass, until he has scarcely power to retain his water—but still persists in refusing to answer the calls of nature.

    </li>
    <li id=6326 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      At length he leaves the warm room for the cold night air, and finds himself unable to void a drop of urine without the greatest difficulty, and perhaps after every effort and the most excruciating agony, he finds it utterly impossible.

    </li>
    <li id=6327 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The most alarming consequences may ensue if immediate relief is not obtained; no time therefore should be lost in using •the Cordial Balm Op Zeylanica which will cause an immediate flow of the urine, when the irritation of the urethra will be removed, and he will recover from the attack.

    </li>
    <li id=6328 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      But Permanent Stricture is not so easily subdued— it attacks every part of the urethra from the uttermost extremity to the very root of the penis.

    </li>
    <li id=6329 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The orifice of the canal is diminished sometimes to thtat extent, that the finest probe cannot be introduced; retention of urine ensues, ulceration follows, and most fatal are the results if not controlled with the utmost tact and skill.

    </li>
    <li id=6330 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Permanent Stricture approaches so imperceptibly, that persons are frequently not aware of its presence until it is to firmly established.

    </li>
    <li id=6331 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      For a very long period he may be suffering from gleet—the disease progresses; on rising in the morning he perceives a glutinous substance covering the orifice and nut of the penis, arising from the discharge from the diseased parts; the urine flows in a forked or double stream and then as the accumulated matter is dissolved it becomes natural.

    </li>
    <li id=6332 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      When Stricture is allowed to continue, it prevents in a greater or less degree the seminal emission, forcing it backwards into the bladder, thus rendering the individual sterile and disqualified from entering into the matrimonial state; thus, persons in the prime of life, and in all other respeets well qualified, refuse to form conjugal engagements, are driven to despair, and too often abandon themselves to dissipation and ruin.

    </li>
    <li id=6333 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Notwithstanding the dangers arising from these diseases, they may be subdued when treated in a proper manner; in fact, there should be no delay in those cases, every method adopted, without the loss of time.&#39;

      In the the first stages of the venereal disease, the poisonous virus can be easily eradicated from the system by efficient remedies administered with skill, and by abstaining from those vicious indulgences which entail so much misery on the votary of pleasure; but if the malady is allowed to progress with all its horrors, or if the evils are aggravated by injudicious treatment, or by the rash and indiscriminate use of mercury by the unskilful, the effects are soon apparent; the eye loses its lustre, a pale languor is spread over the countenance, sometimes tinged with an hectic flush, as in consumptive cases; but beneath the illusive surface may be traced the impress of disease.

      Inflammation ensues, pimples, carbuncles blisters, and pustules rise up in the face, forehead, chin, nose, throat, and palate; these sores suppurate, run one in the other very often, and cover the greater part or the whole of the countenance.

      There is not a bone, muscle, sinew, nerve, or bloodvessel in the human system that is not liable to its baneful influence; it consequently creates the most alarming disorders, if neglected or aggravated by injudicious treatment, predisposing the system to consumption of nervous kinds, rheumatism, scrofula, diseases of the nervous system, palsies, and incurable diseases of the stomach, liver, and bowels.

      The inflammation is generally higher when the sore is on the prepuce or fraenum; and if great care is not observed, the destruction of the glans or a portion of the penis is likely to take place.

      After a certain time, varying according to the virulence of the disease, if the chancre is not removed, the poison is conveyed by the absorbents branching from the penis to the glans in the groin, one or both become inflamed and enlarged, producing the swelling known by the name of bubo.

      After suppuration has taken place, and the severity of the disease is not assuaged, the abscess will slough, destroying the adjacent parts; instances are known where even the femoral artery has been exposed, ulcerated, and the patient deprived of life by haemorrhage.

      It is here necessary to state, as a caution, that a chancre may be conveyed to any part of the body where the skin is tender or broken, or to a mucous surface, such as the eye, the nostril, the lip, the nipple, by the application of the matter.

      It appeared from his own history of the case that after suspicious intercourse, a small angry pimple formed upon the inside of the foreskin which soon ulcerated, and in the ordinary course, buboes formed in each of the groins.

      Under the treatment of his confidential surgical adviser, he took mercury very freely, the chancre slowly healed, suppuration occurred in each of the swellings, and for a time after the cicatrization of each abscess, he was requested to continue the use of his mercurial remedies.

      Supposing that his pains were merely rheumatic, he derived some trifling and temporary relief from the warm bath and the use of guaiacum, and an opiate on going to bed.

      The following abounds with incidents the most remarkable and interesting that ever occurred to the authors during their practice :—

It was on the of January, 1838, a note was delivered to us, stating that a gentleman felt very desirous of having an interview on the following evening, about half-past five.

    </li>
    <li id=6434 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      In accordance with the reply, which stated Mr. R.

    </li>
    <li id=6435 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Brodie would be disengaged at that hour, the gentleman called.

    </li>
    <li id=6436 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      He stated he was a large landholder; had been a widower about three years; after being married about two years and a half, Lis wife died, aged twenty-three.

    </li>
    <li id=6437 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      With downcast eyes, he acknowledged the marriage rite was never consummated, in consequence of incapacity on his part.

    </li>
    <li id=6438 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Having seen, in one of the metropolitan journals, our advertisement, he was induced to have advice.

    </li>
    <li id=6439 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Mr. E.

    </li>
    <li id=6440 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Brodie, with whom he had the interview, on further conversation found he was the representative of one of the most ancient families in the kingdom; that he inherited extensive estates from a long line of ancestry ; was a man of profound learning; but, with the deepest anguish, he declared the fruits of his academical labours would never compensate for the mischief incurred from a solitary vice taught him by a depraved companion, when he was about thirteen years of age.

    </li>
    <li id=6441 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      No sooner had the delusion empire over every other desire, than he sought every opportunity to indulge in those pernicious and demoralising habits.

    </li>
    <li id=6442 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Six years passed on in this way, during which time his mother— (for his father died during his infancy)—perceived an alteration in his appearance; from a robust youth, he became feeble and emaciated.

    </li>
    <li id=6443 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      No one but a parent can imagine the mental agony this worthy lady endured, on beholding her beloved boy under the withering influence of consumption—her first and only child—the heir to unbounded wealth—the only link left to extend the chain—to preserve the memory of an ancient race.

    </li>
    <li id=6444 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Of course, no expense was spared in having the first advice in the kingdom.

    </li>
    <li id=6445 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Medical art succeeded, to a certain degree; the boy&#39;s health slightly improved, so that he was enabled to pursue his studies; but he continued debilitated, aud unequal to the least exertion, and without any zest for those salutary recreations, so necessary to relax the juvenile mind.

    </li>
    <li id=6446 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      In this state he went to college, propped up, as it were, by art.

    </li>
    <li id=6447 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The causes of the disease were not eradicated; the infirmity still continued, for the medical men had no idea from whence the malady sprang: thus was a promising youth, of bright intellect, and an excellent constitution, blighted apparently in the morning of his existence.

    </li>
    <li id=6448 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      As he advanced to years of maturity, he began to perceive the enormity of the crime, and experienced the dreadful results arising from those illusions from which no real pleasure can be elicited: a practice agitating the system, poisoning the source from whence the healthy spring of life flows, perverting the senses, and creating incalculable mischief.

    </li>
    <li id=6449 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Notwithstanding, the demon continued to have sufficient influence to tempt him to repeat, at intervals, the solitary vice; thus frustrating all the efforts and skill of his medical advisers.

    </li>
    <li id=6450 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      He at length perceived to his sorrow how he had perverted the ordinances of nature, and exchanged a powerful and vigorous constitution for a puny, sickly, and debilitated frame.

    </li>
    <li id=6451 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The fact is, this young gentleman was naturally, as has been before observed, strong





and healthy, otherwise he would have sunk under these repeated inroads.

    </li>
    <li id=6452 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Shame held his tongue; no one was aware of his being addicted to those solitary habits.

    </li>
    <li id=6453 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Perceiving the evil, he was resolved to fly from the temptation—he was now about twenty years of age.

    </li>
    <li id=6454 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      He intimated to his mother a wish to take a tour on the Continent; having met with her approval he left England, accompanied by a medical friend, who could not only watch the disease, but be his companion during his journeyings—cheering and amusing him on the way; for he was now miserable in mind, as well as indisposed in health.

    </li>
    <li id=6455 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      By acting up to his determination he experienced a trifling improvement whilst abroad, but still suffered pains in the back and loins, loss of appetite and indigestion, with many other bad symptoms, produced by Masturbation.

    </li>
    <li id=6456 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      During his travelling on the Continent, he indulged himself frequently in sexual intercourse; at length he •was obliged to refrain from that gratification from inability; for sometimes, in the act of coition, he experienced erection without emission; but the erection accompanied with the most excruciating agony in the genitals, and across the loins and back—at other times he experienced an involuntary emission without erection, merely on approaching the object of his desire.

    </li>
    <li id=6457 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      After taking a tour up the Rhine, through Switzerland, he returned home by the way of France.

    </li>
    <li id=6458 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      After being in England a short time, he was introduced to a young lady of great beauty and accomplishments, the daughter of a merchant who had retired from commercial pursuits with a large fortune.

    </li>
    <li id=6459 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Being ambitious of a connection with an ancient family, he was very anxious of forming a matrimonial alliance with our patient.

    </li>
    <li id=6460 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      This young gentleman secretly wished, for too good .

    <li id=6461 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      a reason, that this negociation should terminate, and not be carried into effect; but shame, pride, and vanity, caused him to keep within his breast the deficiencies he laboured under.

    </li>
    <li id=6462 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The old gentleman presented to his daughter a handsome dowry; and made a will, bestowing the residue of his immense property on the first son she should have, being determined to aggrandise his name; but if she should fail in having issue, the bequest to go to a distant branch of his family: thus every preliminary being made, they were united: now follows—the dread—the mortification—the consternation—sure to ensue under such circumstances.

    </li>
    <li id=6463 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      If the veil could be drawn aside that conceals the mysterious rites of Hymen, what a scene would be disclosed!

    </li>
    <li id=6464 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      —This young lady&#39;s father centered all his happiness in his daughter&#39;s having a son—she was allied to Impotency!

    </li>
    <li id=6465 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The shock she received must have been acute in the extreme—the disappointment preyed deeply on her mind, and had a visible effect on her health; after a lingering illness of two years, she sank into a premature grave, at the early age of twentythree.

    </li>
    <li id=6466 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      When first we saw this patient, he was dreadfully emaciated, labouring under great difficulty of respiration, pains across the back and loins, involuntary emissions of a thin watery liquid from the urethra, particularly at night.

    </li>
    <li id=6467 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      After confidentially stating his case, he implored us to endeavour to reanimate him; fortunately he was endowed with a strong mind, notwithstanding his frailties; he had resolution enough to forbear, for a considerable time, from those evil propensities that had been his bane.

    </li>
    <li id=6468 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      These circumstances gave us some hopes of being enabled, with the blessing of God, of restoring him to health.

    </li>
    <li id=6469 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      He was furnished with medicines, and the Cordial Balm of Zeylanica, and Purifying Vegetable Pills, directed to have a cold bath three times a week, and to have a light and nutritious diet; and we are happy to state, in the course of three months, the improvement in his health was astonishing.

    </li>
    <li id=6470 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      At the expiration of that time, he went, by our advice, to Aix la Chapelle, where he found the greatest benefit from the waters and change of climate.

    </li>
    <li id=6471 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      On his return, we had another interview with him.

    </li>
    <li id=6472 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      , and strongly recommended him to get married.

    </li>
    <li id=6473 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      About nine months after he followed our advice.

    <li id=6474 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      One morning in March, 1840, we received the following letter, the perusal of which gave us the most heartfelt gratification.

      IMPOTENCY

May arise from a deficiency of vital heat, a weakness of the solids, profuse venery, ill cured claps, gleets o* long continuance, &amp;c, &amp;c, but the most frequent cause of impotency, at that period of existence when man should be in the zenith of his procreative power, is in a general weakness of the generative organs, induced by too early an indulgence in coition, the pernicious and demoralizing crime of masturbation, or the abuse of venereal pleasures.

    </li>
    <li id=6487 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The erector muscles are paralysed from over-use, and the semen if any is secreted, (from the lax and withered state of the testes,) is clear, serous, without consistence, and consequently deficient of prolific virtue.

We had the satisfaction of having a visit from the above gentleman a fortnight after sending the medicine, and the gratification of finding him perfectly restored to health.

    </li>
    <li id=6704 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      We are continually receiving communications from all parts of the country, testifying the success attending our efforts in subduing the disease treated on in these pages; the following is selected from the number.

    </li>
    <li id=6705 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      A gentleman, aged twenty-seven, whose professional pursuits as a minister of a large dissenting congregation, in the North of Yorkshire, rendered his absence from home (excepting at one period of the year,) undesirable, wrote to me in the autumn of 1835, respecting a.

    </li>
    <li id=6706 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      yleety discharge from the urethra, for which he had unsuccessfully employed a variety of remedies.

    </li>
    <li id=6707 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      His confidential surgical attendant had repeatedly introduced the bougie armed with caustic, under the impression that the diseased secretion resulted from stricture in the membraneous portion of the urinary caual.

    </li>
    <li id=6708 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The immediate and invariable result of the use of this instrument was considerable pain in making water: it was ejected with straining, but not so far as usual, and divisable into forked streams.

    </li>
    <li id=6709 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Under these circumstances, the discharge persisting, he communicated with us; and it being impossible to ascertain the actual condition of the urethra, and the existence or absence of stricture without a personal interview; he left home by one of the night coaches, and presented himself at our house the following day.

    </li>
    <li id=6710 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      We found the testicles much disposed to enlargement, and decidedly tender to the touch; and as he had been accustomed to much self-indulgence at the table, the system being irritable, we declined exploring the urethra until a few days&#39; quiet rest, together with the loss of blood from his arm, had subdued the morbid irritability of the parts.

    </li>
    <li id=6711 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Having acted freely on the bowels, we passed a moderate sized bougie, which on reaching the more sensitive portion of the canal, produced faintness.

    </li>
    <li id=6712 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      We repeated the introduction of the same instrument after three days with better success, the suffering being less violent.

    </li>
    <li id=6713 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      He wa3 advised to take an opiate at bed time, and to use an enema of castor oil the following morning.

    </li>
    <li id=6714 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      After a few priliminary attempts at intervals of twice a week, we succeeded at length in reaching the supposed seat of stricture, the instrument being firmly resisted.

    </li>
    <li id=6715 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      This plan of attack was persisted in on alternate days, varying the time of the retention of the bougie, as the patient was better enabled from habit to bear it: after a fortnight&#39;s perseverance, we had the gratification to find the same instrument suddenly pass the stricture, and fairly enter the bladder.

    </li>
    <li id=6716 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Steady gentle, and oft repeated pressure, had accomplished what could not be affected by violence and severity, which indeed, only serve to aggravate all the secondary consequences of the constriction, and materially augment the irritable inflammation producing the discharge.

    </li>
    <li id=6717 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      In six weeks longer, by the introduction of the bougie twice a week, our patient recovered completely and returned home ; the discharge having completely ceased, and the urine passing without effort in a full stream from the bladder.

    </li>
    <li id=6718 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      A Commercial Traveller, whose habits of life had been tolerably free, summoned me hastily in the night to his Inn, under the following circumstances :—He stated that he had been affected with gonorrhoea about six weeks, haying contracted the infection while in a state of inebriety.

    </li>
    <li id=6719 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      It appears that in a few days after the commencement of the disease, the penis became very red, swollen, and painful: a smart fever set in, and presently a dark spot made its appearance on the body &#39;of that organ, and gradually extended round it.

    </li>
    <li id=6720 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      He had been bled at his own request, and had taken extreme and frequent doses of some advertised specific in the form of pills, until salivation induced him to desist.

    </li>
    <li id=6721 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Meanwhile, the lividity assumed the distinct character of a large slough, which seperating exposed an irregular and most irritable sore.

    </li>
    <li id=6722 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      It was evident that the work of destruction was not yet complete; and that aggravated by the unnecessary and injurious use of the above evidently mercurial remedies, all effort to save further portions of the penis would be comparatively hopeless, however, the effort was made.

    </li>
    <li id=6723 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The sloughing process laid open a fistulous entrance into the urethra, from which, instead of the natural outlet, the urine was suffered to escape; and it really appeared probable at one period, that the whole anterior extremity of the penis would be cast off by the rapid gangrenous action.

    </li>
    <li id=6724 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      We ordered the surface of the sore to be bathed with a warm strong stimulant application, and advised appropriate internal remedies.

    </li>
    <li id=6725 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Carefully watching the case, we had the satisfaction to witness the destructive extension of the slough arrested, the dead parts on seperating, exposed a more healthy surface than might be expected, and the newly exposed wound was dressed with the same application as the originally gangrenous ulcer.

    </li>
    <li id=6726 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Three weeks from the date of our first visit, the slough had entirely seperated at Ihe upper portion of the penis, leaving the extremity of the glans bare, but uninjured; the integuments to some extent behind it seperated, leaving a ragged, extensive, ulcerated surface.

    </li>
    <li id=6727 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The pulse was then quick, the skin hot, the tongue furred, and the marks of constitutional irritation tolerably severe.

    </li>
    <li id=6728 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Calomel, in alternative doses, conjoined with opiates were administered at bed time; every second morning, small doses of castor oil were given, and during the day, the acetate of ammonia, with tincture of henbane, varied afterwards for the carbonate of ammonia in effervescence.

    </li>
    <li id=6729 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The patient now obtained rest at night, the aspect of the wound became less angry; the lotion of nitric acid with opium, was substituted for the vegetable stimulant, and the gonorrboeal discharge from the urethra, which had been partially suspended, again escaped freely.

    </li>
    <li id=6730 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      After another week, the wound began to granuate, yet without the disposition to contraction; but as it became more clean, and less painful, pure nitric acid was applied to the edges; the decoction of sarsaparilla, with immediate doses of the sulphate of quinine, and a free allowance of animal food and bottled porter were also advised; and under this treatment, the patient&#39;s progress towards convalescense was most satisfactory.

    </li>
    <li id=6731 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      From this period the healing process went on uninteruptedly; the gonorrhceal inflammation of the urethra subsided, and after the cicatrization of the ulcer, the fistulous edges of the opening midway into the uretha, were easily closed by exciting the adhesive inflammation, and in less than sixteen weeks from the date of our first visit, we had the satisfaction of meeting our patient (still somewhat weak and pale,) in a gig on the way to Burnley, in pursuit of his commercial avocations.

      The case we are about transcribing, most forcibly shows the necessity of ascertaining from the patient afflicted with Gonorrhoea whether it is accompanied with Chordee, which is generally the case; for if not subdued, the most serious consequences may arise, from the irritability it causes to the whole system.

    </li>
    <li id=6766 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      An engineer, in the employ of the Great Western Eailway Company, called upon us respecting a Chordee, which caused him the most excruciating agony and inconvenience, so much so, that he declared he should be obliged to leave his situation, if he could not obtain relief.

    </li>
    <li id=6767 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      About a fortnight before we saw him, he contracted, from an impure connection, Gonorrhoea in its severest form.

    </li>
    <li id=6768 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      He suffered extreme scalding on voiding urine, and the discharge from the urethra was very profuse.

    </li>
    <li id=6769 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      These symptoms were mitigated in some degree by the remedies he had taken; but he declared the greatest dread seized him when the hour of rest approached, for no sooner did he get warm in bed, than the erection of the penis ensued, causing the most intense agony, and followed by a copious emission of semen, and a continual inclination to make water, without the ability of doing so.

    </li>
    <li id=6770 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Every night was passed in walking up and down the room, and bathing the parts in cold water, until he was shivering with the cold, and as soon as he retired to his bed, the Chordee returned with redoubled violence.

    </li>
    <li id=6771 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      From these symptoms it was very evident he had been taking medicines of a stimulating nature.

    </li>
    <li id=6772 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Our mode of treatment was very opposite: he now began to take our Vegetable Pills, which composed the agitation the system was thrown into, subduing the inflammation, entirely removing every unpleasant symptom.

    </li>
    <li id=6773 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Thus the man was enabled to attend to his usual occupations, and in the course of three weeks was restored to perfect health.

    </li>
    <li id=6774 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      In the course of our practice, many cases have been submitted to us of pains in the limbs, commonly denominated rheumatism, which we have often found to be the result of a Venereal Taint, from which the system has not been effectually purified.

    </li>
    <li id=6775 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      These cases assume many forms and prove tedious and difficult to cure, if the medical man is not aware of the origin of the complaint.

    </li>
    <li id=6776 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Sometimes it attacks the back and loins, at other times the feet—thus producing lameness— followed by a general debility of the whole system.

    </li>
    <li id=6777 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Many such cases can be enumerated, but the following may suffice to show the multiform nature of the disease.

    </li>
    <li id=6778 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      A gentleman, filling an official situation in the Bank of England, consulted us, merely to be satisfied in his own mind whether the complaint he laboured under proceeded from cold or any other cause; he felt, he said, violent rheumatic pains across his back, sometimes from the nape of the neck to the other extremity of the spine.

    </li>
    <li id=6779 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      When he called upon us, he complained of severe pains in the left knee and right ankle, which produced lameness, so that he could not walk across the room without difficulty.

    </li>
    <li id=6780 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      We found a slight eruption of a chocolate colour across the shoulders, which, with the other symptoms, caused us to suspect the deplorable state the gentleman was in arose from Venereal Infection, contracted at a former period; neither were we wrong in our surmises.

    </li>
    <li id=6781 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The patient was about thirty-eight years of age, and confessed that he indulged in promiscuous sexual intercourse, about twelve or thirteen years before applying to us: when he married, and consequently led a more regular life : he had frequent attacks of Gonorrhoea; the very last time he had that unpleasant visitor, he took the remedies that relieved him before: the discharge was soon stopped, but was followed by a swelling of the testicle, which obliged him ever since to wear a suspensory bandage; this attack proved very irksome for a long period.

    </li>
    <li id=6782 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      He declared to us, he never enjoyed perfect health from that time, and was always suffering the most excruciating pains in his limbs: we rightly attributed his sufferings to the Venereal virus not being completely eradicated from the system, and also to the undue administration of mercury: we treated him accordingly, administered the Cordial Balm of Zeylanica and the Purifying Vegetable Pills, with other appropriate remedies; and in the course of six months he was perfectly recovered.

      , aged 29, of full habit of body, had in early life addicted himself to the practice of self-pollution; but after indulging in it for some time he was induced





to relinquish it from the sad effects he found it to produce in the health of a friend of his.

    </li>
    <li id=6786 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      After having given up the habit, he experienced an involuntary seminal discharge, but this, after a time began to disappear, except either when the state of his bowels were neglected, or he indulged too much in the use of alcoholic drinks.

    </li>
    <li id=6787 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      He was naturally of a strong constitution, and his health suffered but little from the practice of masturbation above alluded to.

    </li>
    <li id=6788 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      When about the age of twenty he contracted gonorrhoea, for which he submitted to medical treatment; during the progress of this he had swelled testicles, the size of one gland was considerably larger than that of the other, even for years after the disease was removed.

    </li>
    <li id=6789 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      From this period up to the time of his consulting us (an interval of between eight and nine years), he was troubled with more or less of a sero-seminal discharge from the urethra, which improved or became worse, according, to his occasional deviation from regular regimen and habits of living ; the discbarge always and invariably became aggravated, after his having sexual intercourse; the enlarged size of one testicle which had continued since the gonorrhoea, as also the seminal discharge which still annoyed him, became to him a source of considerable uneasiness.

    </li>
    <li id=6790 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      He found also that on attempting to have intercourse with a female, his semen was discharged almost before ingress was effected.

    </li>
    <li id=6791 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      He now contemplated matrimony, an advantageous offer presenting itself in that way, but was deterred from entering into so responsible a state without consulting some one with respect to the state of his genital organs and their debilitated tone.

    </li>
    <li id=6792 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      He accordingly consulted a medical man, who, after prescribing some medicines for him, encouraged him to marry forthwith, assuring him that all was right; he did so, but on the first night of his marriage he had ample reason to regret his precipitancy; he was totally unable to perform the marriage duty.

    </li>
    <li id=6793 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      This state of debility, and indeed of absolute impotence, continued for some months, when he consulted us.

    <li id=6794 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      We undertook the case, restricted him to a peculiar regimen; interdicted all sexual intercourse for some time; submitted him to a course of the Cordial Balm of Zeylanica and Purifying Vegetable Pills such as the nature of the case indicted, and hi about four weeks he was perfectly restored to the full possession of his powers as a husband.

      A gentleman consulted us about three years ago in a sad state of nervous agitation and alarm, from the impresssion, not altogether groundless, that he was rapidly becoming the subject of generative debility.

    </li>
    <li id=6814 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      There was no difficulty in ascertaining, that early injurious habits, in which, without knowledge or fear of





their consequences, he had indulged, were the unforseen cause of his weakness.

    </li>
    <li id=6815 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      He had formed a matrimonial engagement about five or six months previous to his first consultation, and much to his annoyance and mortification, every attempt to discharge the connubial obligation was foiled in consequence of the seminal fluid escaping involuntarily, and with only imperfect erection, every time he would fain have vigorously approached the partner of his desires.

    </li>
    <li id=6816 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Sexual power appeared to be so far perverted as to be almost if not altogether gone.

    <li id=6817 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      He informed us that he had waited more than three months in the vain hope his incapacity would disappear.

    </li>
    <li id=6818 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      But at length he became assured, that without professional assistance, habit and time would probably make his debility permament, and under these circumstances it was that we first saw him.

    </li>
    <li id=6819 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      He informed us, that the only dread he was accustomed to feel from indulgence in self-pollution in days gone by, arose from the growing sense of very indefinable feelings, which when present in their greatest severity powerfully affected his stomach, producing nervous indigestion of the worst kind, with horrible depression of spirits.

    </li>
    <li id=6820 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      But his feeble powers as a husband were now traceable by an accusing and remorseless spirit to the weakness of youthful years, and justly so.

      It was rendered evident he had long been subject to nocturnal emissions, but to this he had been accustomed to attach not the slightest importance, vainly imagining there was nothing of disease or unnatural debility in that unconscious discharge.

    </li>
    <li id=6822 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      However, the sense of increasing and apparently hopeless Impotence, rendered him at times so wretched that life became a burden, and, as he informed us, his misery was precisely of that description which could seek for no alleviation from reposing it with her who naturally felt the most affectionate interest in his welfare.

    </li>
    <li id=6823 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      On her account, he bitterly blamed himself, and never shall we forget the look of delight and wondering joy his countenance assumed when first we told him his case was not past remedy, nor will the hour be forgotten by either of us when first he came half wild and laughingly to tell that he felt returning power.

    </li>
    <li id=6824 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      In possession of his entire confidence, and having obtained a knowledge of every fact bearing upon his case, we adopted such remedies the action of which tended to allay all morbid irritability of the seminal vessels, and under this treatment he steadily proceeded to the entire possession of sexual power.

    </li>
    <li id=6825 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The nightly emissions were soon suppressed.

      SECONDARY SYMPTOMS.

    <li id=6894 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      In the treatment of secondary symptoms, it must not be forgotten that the disease is not merely superficial and local, but constitutional; therefore efficient remedies that may cause a happy change in the constitution must be administered; temporary relief is of no avail, for when these medicines cease to have any influence, the alarming symptoms reappear in an aggravated form.

    </li>
    <li id=6895 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      In a former part of this book we have fully expressed our opinions respecting the indiscriminate use of mercury; our experience convinces us, if the disease is treated judiciously at the commencement, there is no fear of danger; but, by throwing into the system quantities of that mineral without skill or judgement, produces a host of evils.

    </li>
    <li id=6896 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The following fully illustrates this position—a blacksmith a short time since presented himself at our establishment, from Croydon, in Surrey, about thirtytwo years of age.

      When he addressed us, we could scarcely distinguish what he said, from the peculiar hoarseness of his voice and the impediment in his articulation, caused, as we afterwards perceived, by the total extinction of his palate.

    </li>
    <li id=6898 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Every part of his body was covered with a copper-coloured eruption—(see engraving,) the pains in his limbs, particularly at night, were excruciating.

    </li>
    <li id=6899 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      On examining his mouth





and throat, we found the palate consumed, and the tonsils very much inflamed, and he complained of great difficulty in swallowing.

    </li>
    <li id=6900 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      He acknowledged, about a twelvemonth before applying to us, he had ulcers in the glans of the penis, and took some preparations from a druggist in the town, a friend of his , after taking them about eight days his mouth became sore, and the chancres disappeared; he now congratulated himself on his recovery—but how soon did he perceive his error!

    </li>
    <li id=6901 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      for in a short time he found his mouth dreadfully ulcerated; he had advice at Croydon, was again salivated, rapidly grew worse, and was in the state above described when we first saw him.

      We lost no time in enforcing upon this unfortunate patient, the positive necessity of his abandoning his unmanly and destructive habit; and when fully satisfied that this was done, we undertook the management of his case, and by the operation of such medicines as were required in so extreme an instance, we had the satisfaction of succeeding in about ten weeks, in effecting his entire restoration to health.

      Of all the dangerous gratifications, that strew the path from youth to manhood, none are so mischievous as the indulgence in Onanism.

      No practice, exercise, or occupation, so disturbs the free and equal circulation of blood in the brain as masturbation.

    </li>
    <li id=6962 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The blood may be quickened in particular parts of the system without the whole circulation participating in such a disturbance, but when that is the case, the neighbouring parts to those affected, are deficiently supplied, and consequently their functions become perverted or temporarily paralyzed.

    </li>
    <li id=6963 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      We know not how the communication between the cerebellum (the supposed regulator of the amative feelings) is connected with the organs referred to, but we do know that the hind part of the head indicates, by certain symptoms, such as heat or pain, and, phrenologically speaking, hy size and form, the state and character of the genital organs, and we farther know, that when those organs are in a state of undue excitement or disease, the circulation of the blood in the cerebellum is disturbed, and if increased, the other parts of the brain receive a less supply, and if diminished, on the contrary.

    </li>
    <li id=6964 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Hence arises an altered action in some parts of the brain to the detriment of the proper and correct working of its functions: the effects are sad estrangements from healthful feelings.

      The perceptive and reflective faculties, abiding in the anterior and upper part of the brain become weakened or deranged, and hence all the morbid sensations that harass the sensualist.

      We are capable of enduring a certain amount of fatigue or enjoyment, day by day: the excess of one may be relieved by rest on the second: but it is possi ble to overtax our capability, and no reaction can be commanded.

      Let us think for a moment how we overstetch our powers, when we are obliged to call all our imagination to aid us in producing a sensation, that instinct properly directed could furnish in an instant without labour or fatigue, but which, when sought for as it is, by a process is at variance with the recognized notions of decency and recitude.

    <li id=6976 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      His cure consisted of a suppression of the discharge at least, except occasionally a slight oozing of a little matter from the orifice of the penis, in the morning, perhaps, once a week, or oftener if he lived freely: but the cause of his application to us was to obtain relief from a vexatious and sudden rheumatic attack.

      Gonorrhoeal rheumatism differs very little from ordinary rheumatism; they both doubtlessly spring from the same cause although differently named; and that cause is cold taken by a patient in delicate health, and .

    <li id=6982 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The only difference between ordinary rheumatism, and rheumatism ensuing after gonorrhoea, is, according to our experience and belief, that on the latter occasion the disease is less severe on account of the health being reduced only temporarily and by medicine, which state of health may be speedily recovered when the medicine is omitted, whereas in ordinary rheumatism, the attack is generally confined to persons of long-continued failing health, and which is decidedly the more difficult to treat as speedily and successfully as the gonorrhoeal rheumatism.

    </li>
    <li id=6983 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      However, doctors differ, not only in their notions of disease, but also of treatment, and in few complaints is there greater diversity than in rheumatism.

    <li id=6984 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Rheumatism is inflammation of particular structures of the body, and these structures are generally the tendonous coverings of joints, the sheaths or &quot;quilts&quot; of muscles, and the various membranes: there are various degrees of inflammation, and, according to the amount, so corresponds the general disturbance: the treatment must be modified by circumstances.

      Upon examination it was found that there was an excrescence within the eighth part of an inch of the orifice of the urethra, besides several irritable spots at different distances in the passage; local irritations of these kinds tend much to injure the general health, and we have known many morbid feelings to disappear on the removal of a urethral discharge, a stricture, or on the subsidence of vesical irritability: the inflammatory symptoms, which were not extraordinarily severe in this instance, were controlled by temperate diet, rest, and a course of the Cordial Balm of Zeylanica and the Purifying Vegetable Pills: the Patient was restored to perfect health in three weeks.

      The gentleman was between five and six and twenty years of age.

    <li id=6993 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      He was the son of opulent parents, and had past the earlier portion of his life at a collegiate school, where he acquired the habit of lonely abuse.

    </li>
    <li id=6994 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      On emerging in the world, his propensity gained pace with his years, and he rarely suffered a day to elapse without resorting to it once at least, or more occasionally.

    </li>
    <li id=6995 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Having no necessity to settle to any fixed employment,





the time hung most heavily upon his hands.

    </li>
    <li id=6996 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Whether in town or country, he was a lounger among his friends and acquaintances.

    <li id=6997 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      Although opportunities were not wanting to hold intercourse with females, yet fear of a two-fold nature kept him aloof from such an enjoyment :—the fear that he might not succeed, for the first and only attempt at actual intercourse with one of the sex, was a failure, owing to the sudden escape of the seminal fluid before he could effect the necessary entrance —and the fear of contracting some infectious disorder.

    </li>
    <li id=6998 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      He therefore persevered in his pernicious indulgence, aiding his excitation by the perusal of works of an immoral tendency.

    </li>
    <li id=6999 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The first notion that he had that the habit he had encountered was absolutely injurious in a physical point of view was that his nights were disturbed, and that he had occasionally nocturnal seminal emissions, many of which he became not aware of, until getting up to dress in the morning.

    </li>
    <li id=7000 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      The day after such an occurrence, he felt unhinged, he experienced also considerable lassitude, and a disinclination to stir out.

    </li>
    <li id=7001 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      His appetite remained dormant until the afternoon, when he found he required stimuli to arouse him.

      To seek relief from this new feature, this growing hypochondriacism, he sought the pleasures of the table, and took more plentifully than salutarily of wine.

    </li>
    <li id=7004 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      His desire to indulge in his old habit had considerably diminished, not having the same wishful feelings as formerly, but the nightly attacks of unconscious discharge increased in frequency and unpleasantness.

      Not being informed of the true state of the case, but most likely suspecting it, he gave an opinion that it was owing to general debility, probably depending on ennui, idle habits, and London confinement.

    <li id=7007 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      A trip was suggested; change of air was sought, and a twelvemonth was consumed in travelling about.

      Among the visits he had made, several were paid to friends (early associates) who had become benedicts, and many inducements had presented themselves that he should imitate their example.

      He had abandoned, from positive loss of inclination, his youthful fatuity, but he was more annoyed than ever with the unsolicited night attacks of seminal discharge.

      His hands were cold and damp, as were also his feet; his pulse languid, his skin dry and shrivelled, flesh flabby, and his whole look that of a consumptive person.

      I feel as though I could break the ice best by letter, and if afterwards, it be deemed by you more advantageous that I should avail myself of a personal interview, I will gladly come to Birmingham for that purpose.

      It is now about five years since I first became habitually addicted to a practice, which I will not more minutely specify.

    </li>
    <li id=7045 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      During the last few months I have not indulged so frequently, for two reasons, partly from fear that it might cause some indefinable detriment, but chiefly from really increasing debility, and such a host of diseased feelings and positive ill health, as proved quite sufficient to destroy the lustful desires in which the act originates.

    </li>

      My general symptoms have been lowness of spirits, heaviness, wandering pains of a severe character, in various parts of my body, but chiefly my head and back, as well as down the backs of my thighs.

    </li>

      The circumstance that renders me most uneasy just now, is a strange unnatural coldness and weight affecting one of my testicles, hardly amounting to pain, and I notice that these bodies hang more loosely than natural, the skin covering them is never tightly puckered up as formerly, and I seldom or never experience a natural erection.

    </li>
    <li id=7048 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      With this I ought to mention, that I have a difficuly in making water, sometimes it suddenly stops, or I feel an urgent desire frequently in the course of a few hours, yet can only void a little, and that occasionally with severe effort and after waiting several minutes.

    </li>

      There is a discharge falls on my linen which resembles the white of egg more than any other fluid, with which I can compare it, being quite clear and slightly glutinous.

      The penis is exceedingly relaxed, and I fancy smaller than formerly, the extremity of the foreskin is reddened, sore, and excessively tender, and a very unpleasant foetid discharge is apt to form in the bend of either groin, with an inflamed dryness of the skin that for a day or two precedes it.

    </li>
    <li id=7051 style="background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);">
      From the weakness of my seminal organs I am apt to lose seed in my sleep, fancying at such times I am clasping in my embrace some person or other on whom my thoughts have turned during the day.

      To this habit he adhered almost without intermission till he attained his twenty-second year, when becoming sensible of the sad ravages which it was committing on his constitution, he gradually discontinued the habit, and has now relinquished it altogether; he is affected, however, with head-aches, dizziness, dimness of vision lassitude and weakness of the loins, aversion to all exertion, whether bodily or mental, and profuse nocturnal emissions.

      Having now brought this brief summary of the disastrous results of Sensualism to its termination, and having selected a few, from among many illustrative cases, as depicting, by example, the truths we have advanced, we would wish our efforts to be regarded more especially by the young, as a brief warning, and faithful outline of the sufferings incidental to unnatural and vicious indulgence: so that they may be in possession of those necessary cautions against the prevalence of a vice, not more detrimental to themselves, than to the interests and welfare of the whole community.

      This happens, in some measure, from the absence of that confidence on the part of the patient, who hesitating to reveal the secret cause of their disorders, act unfairly by their medical advisers: but, in the majority of instances, professional men themselves are so unaccustomed to seek such inquiries, to detect the sources of disease that they escape unnoticed.
