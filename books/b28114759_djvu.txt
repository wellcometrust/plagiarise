PREFACE.


The science of physiology teaches us
that the human body is constructed
upon the most exact mechanical princi-
ples, and the more perfectly it is under-
stood, the more is our wonder excited at
the power and goodness of that Being to
whom it owes existence ; but like every
other complex machine, its very perfec-
tion renders it more liable to derange-
ment, and imposes an additional obliga-
tion upon its possessor, to preserve and
regulate it with the most scrupulous at-
tention, — to use it carefully, with a due
regard to its powers, — and to watch over
and protect it from injury or accident,
with the greatest care and vigilance.

To unveil, therefore, and to distinguish
truth from error, and to point out and
correct false opinions, which have given
rise to practices of the most injurious
tendency as regards our health, strength,

and peace of mind, — to bring to light and
enforce upon the attention those irre-
futable evils whioh mankind, from the
love of ease, and indulgence of certain
contracted habits, are disposed to, till
roused by the actual feelings of mental
and bodily suffering, — to endeavour to
establish such fundamental principles, as
may serve to eradicate the deeply-rooted
vices which oppose themselves to every
dictate of nature, and thereby reclaim the
strayed ones to the path of virtue and
rectitude, are the ends here had in view.

The Almighty did not originally
create man weak and ailing, nor do
we learn from ancient history that
he began to deteriorate till very
many centuries after his creation ;
but, on the contrary, attained an age
far more advanced than those of the
present generation, in the fullest en-
joyment of health and manly vigour.
What is the cause of this miserable
change ? Why does such a frightful
catalogue of ills now assail him ? A
departure from the purity observed
by our forefathers, and an adoption
of an unnatural and artificial mode
of living.

The multiplied evils, pains, and
sorrows, detailed in the ensuing
pages, form a melancholy yet faith-
ful transcript of the consequences of
vicious indulgence, affording the
strongest evidence how widely ex-
tended are the sufferings arising from
perversion of the nervous and mus-

cular systems, for, of all tlie ailments
of which the human system is sus-
ceptible, there are none more certainly
destructive , more various or diversi-
fied, either as to their nature or their
seat, than those resulting from self-
acquired habits, and the immoderate
loss of the system’s most important
fluid . The varieties, arising from
differences of habit, age, or station,
may affect the intensity and severity
of these affections, hut the basis of
them is identical in all, requiring a
treatment which admits of no modi-
fication beyond that specified by
personal circumstances. In their
earlier stages, we find them so in-
sidious and concealed, as often to es-
cape observation, excepting to that
of the practised eye accustomed to
their detection and cure, frequently
bearing the resemblance of other
affections, and assuming, in turn, the
character of several of the most fatal
maladies.

We are confident that the follow-
ing pages will be found most useful
to the unwary and thoughtless. To

the absence of those all-important
warnings the general practitioner
neglects to give, may oft be ascribed
the long chain of evils which will be
hereafter enumerated. The source
of many complicated disorders re-
sulting from a vicious course of life
is often well known to the sufferer,
who conceals within his breast the
secret, he hesitates to reveal. To
such a cause is not unfrequently
attributable the incapacity of those
unhappy beings who, in the apparent
enjoyment of health, have been sud-
denly arrested by the total loss of
manly vigour, and thus rendered in-
capable of participating in those
duties which are among the most
sacred of human nature. Numerous
are the instances of premature de-
cline; of manhood sinking into the
grave from early excess ; of youth
chained by noxious indolence and
complete imbecility, caused by self-
sought ruinous practices, the only
hope cherished, that science will re-
store the ebbing energies.

We have been induced, for many

years, to forego tlie routine of gene-
ral practice, for the sake of devoting
ourselves exclusively to a much
neglected, and yet most important
department of private practice ; and
when we reflect upon the dreadful
consequences, — the welfare of man-
kind, — the perpetuation of heredi-
tary debility through distant genera-
tions, — the pangs and miseries which
Sensual Indulgence inflicts upon the
poor votaries of delusive gratifica-
tion, — we cannot fail to perceive that
ours is a selection of study superior
in every way to any that can employ
the human faculties, since there is
none more fitted to excite the sym-
pathies that arise from the contem-
plation of the multiplied woes of the
feeble, the languishing, the despond-
ing, and the solitary. When we
have found the results of our own
observations to run parallel with the
recorded suggestions of practical
writers, we have not failed to seize
upon all that has been useful or ap-
licable ; and, on the other hand, no
authority, however high, or defended

sufficient to chain us within the
trammels of old-fashioned custom.

The consequences of youthful in-
discretion, as well as the apparently
forgotten traces of hidden losses, are
painfully recalled to recollection in
after-life ; and many serious com-
plaints are altogether unsuspected,
both as to their nature and origin.
In this way, debility of the local
organs is often maintained by a
cause which could easily be reme-
died, if known or avowed. Fortunate
indeed is the man who, in attempting
to avail himself of that assistance
which is within the legitimate appli-
cation of science, escapes the dull,
useless routine of the mere general
practitioner, who, without the slight-
est familiarity with the first link in
the chain of microscopical and ana-
lytical evidence, boldly prescribes
the medicines which are sanctioned
by general custom, and leaves the
miserable patient to the last chance
of surviving, not merely the conse-
quences of self-sought indiscretions 9

but the MISAPPLICATION OP SUPPOSED
REMEDIES.

Our most earnest wishes will be
amply realised, if, while we attempt
to direct parents, guardians, heads
op families, and Directors of Public
Schools to a careful study of the
subject of this little work, we shall
have been instrumental in checking
the spread of those evils which we
deem it part of our duty to alleviate
and cure.

Among the complaints which fall
under the cognizance of the physi-
cian, or surgeon, there are none more
neglected, none less practically under-
stood, than those slow, and insidious
maladies which often at first pro-
duce no very sudden, remarkable,
or violent changes : and of this
class the forms of Indigestion and
Consumption in all their varieties,
resulting from secret inadvertency
in youth, or from sensual excesses,
are decidedly most to be noted.
These ailments, and many others, in
most cases are attributed to any
cause with the exception of the

correct one, such diseases proving
mortal not so directly because of
their inveteracy, but from having,
perhaps, existed for some time in the
constitution without their secret
source being known. A malady
once understood, is in a fair way to-
wards removal ; a baneful habit de-
tected and prevented, by necessary
remedies, no longer entails upon the
sufferer the mischiefs which are per-
petuated in its train. It is therefore
a matter of the gravest importance,
and absolutely indispensable, to as-
certain the secret springs of action
and habit. The neglect of these has
entailed failure upon the generality
of those practitioners who have upon
supposed surmisings attempted .the
removal of maladies consequent upon
hidden practices, which the patient
could not be induced to reveal, and
which, in the absence of that neces-
sary tact, could not be arrived at
by men unfamiliar with such in-
quiries.

That these premises are true, is,
unfortunately for the world at large,

GENERAL REMARKS.


sufficiently proved in every-day life
observable in the absurd treatment
pursued in absolute ignorance of the
principal cause of derangement, from
which the most important organs
suffer. A celebrated writer on this
most engrossing subject, whose
great abilities as a practical physi-
cian were only equalled by his
acquired learning and innate know-
ledge of human nature, says : —
“ There is a vast deal of injury done,
not merely to public morals, but to
individual health, by the abuses and
excesses of the reproductive func-
tions ; the primitive fathers and phy-
sicians have duly noticed the evils to
which I allude, and every experienced
medical practitioner can attest their
frequent occurence. It is all well
for sentimentalists and the mod modest
to declaim about a notice of them , but
justice , morality , and the 'preservation
of health , as well as the perpetuation
of the human race , demand it. Such,
however, is the hypocrisy of the day,
that even a notice in a dead language
is abused and condemned by the

WHY DO THOUSANDS SUFFER?

!

ignorant and intolerant, who are
unable to appreciate the importance
of the subject/’ We say, then,
it is absurd to expect rational treat-
ment in these melancholy cases from
practitioners who are ignorant of the
cause of the disorder, from want of
practical experience.

A diseased condition of the brain,
stomach, or nervous system, will
manifest itself in a tendency to ner-
vous irritation, and a long train ol
hysterical, epileptic, and similar ail-
ments, not excepting incipient in-
sanity, or perhaps in breathlessness,
cough, emaciation, and all the appa-
rently genuine symptoms of Pulmo-
nary Consumption. Such morbid
condition of these organs is often
only secondary ; and, therefore, when
a patient complains of uneasiness in
one or other organ, it is our duty to
watch narrowly whether the part
affected suffer from a cause resident
there, or by consent and sympathy
with some distant and abused organ.
If this distinction be not observed,
no cure can be effected in any in-

stance. It ought to be received,
therefore, as a fundamental truth,
founded on the experience of years,
and on the fatal yet silent sufferings
of thousands now entombed in the
grave, that all parts of the human
body may fail in their office and true
performance of their relative duties,
either by a deficiency in their own
or deprivation and injury from other
parts ; and this is observed in all
these cases consequent upon vicious
and perverted conditions of the mus-
cular and nervous systems, when
they fall into the hands of men who,
adopting this preliminary maxim,
have not made these special ailments
the objects of their peculiar and
exclusive study.

It is for this reason that patients
languish so long under the hands of
the general practitioner, waiting in
vain for relief, inasmuch as it is con-
sistent with the practice of the day,
rather to administer for symptoms
than for the actually existing and
precise condition, of which such
symptoms are only the index; un-

easy sensations in this part or that
are prescribed for, whilst nothing is
thought of remoter sympathies, con-
cluding with the fallacious opinion
that, where pain is, there the disease
exists — ofttimes a serious mistake ;
as, for example : pain in the head
may arise from fulness of the blood-
vessels, as it may also occur from
an exactly opposite condition, most
commonly from irritation, either
seated in the «tomach, spleen, liver,
kidneys, and other vital organs ; and
this in consequence of the fact, that
the nerves , prolonged and spreading
through this vast variety of organs,
have all one ultimate centre of
union, namely, the brain and spinal
marrow, from which it would be
correct to say they originate, or to
which it would be equally correct to
say they converge.

The latent and dangerous progress
of certain affections, when their
origin has remained undiscovered,
not alone undermines the health, but
eventually hurries its victim to an
untimely grave, originating in one

sole and exclusive cause : namely, a
certain and perverted vicious habit, en-
tailing a living death upon its pitiable
votary, for many a dreary year.

The observations long experience
has enabled us to make relatively to
this subject is, that disorders of the
digestive organs, as well as those con-
nected with breathing, namely, the
lungs and heart, consist not always in
actual perversion or incipient change
of structure, but rather (as the result
of a reflected irritation) in a weakness
of the affected parts, accompanied
by a deficiency or depravity of the
fluids secreted by them, and upon
the healthy qualities of which the due
and harmonious performance of their
functions entirely depends.

We often find the impaired facul-
ties of one generation imparted to
succeeding ones, thereby producing a
degenerate race, whose powers fit
them for existence only, but not for
that which may be termed life in the
full acceptation of the term. For
many of these we often prescribe, and
find them complain of the following


SYMPTOMS OF THE PATIENT.

symptoms : melancholy, dejection,

restlessness, desire of change, disin-
clination to physical or even mental
exercise, craving for solitude, in order
to feed on thoughts the subject of
which renders them still more
wretched by being brooded over
alone. Self-reliance is lost, together
with muscular power, lassitude en-
sues, fatigue and pains in the loins
follow, (increased on using the least
exertion,) and the eye which erst
was bright becomes glassy, the lids
shroud it from the glance of others,
whilst a dark circle increases the
already unhealthy appearance of the
face, and the digestive organs suffer
most acutely from weakness, and
the very coats of the stomach are
ultimately injured by the want of
that necessary gastric fluid, which
should enable it to perform the
operation of deglutition.

The frame sinks under the weight
of care, dejection, hopelessness, and
self-reproach ; solitude is sought,
when the mind recoils from the pain-
ful knowledge that utter incapability

must soon doom to lonely wretched-
ness the warm heart that would seek
its greatest happiness in fulfilling the
instinct of its natural want and ob-
ligation. Too soon will the fabric
be totally destroyed, by physical and
mental exhaustion straining each
nerve, atrophy withers and wastes the
last remaining stay (the spinal cord) ;
and the tottering structure must sink
and fall, if not prevented by the ne-
cessary remedies.

Great will be the advantage de-
rivable from one who has made
nervous diseases his special practice
and study, and who, acting the part
of a Mentor, will gently but firmly
lead the patient on the road to
health, stimulating him by medicine
and advice, aiding him when he
stumbles, and re-assuring him when
he despairs : constantly striving to
keep the physical and mental capaci-
ties in a right path until they have
regained sufficient strength to steady
themselves, and thus putting the
patient in the best position to profit by
moral advice and medical knowledge.


CONSEQUENCES IN AFTER LIFE.


15


Mental and physical inadvertencies
in youth must he followed by serious
consequences in after life, which,
when increased (as in many cases) by
intense study and sedentary occupa-
tions, give rise to numerous unde-
fined symptoms, generally called by
the vague term of “ nervousness.”
In these cases, it has been found
that the loss of some important se-
cretion has been going on, often
unknown to the patient, wasting his
strength and laying the germ of
severe afflictions, which, if neglected,
must lead to most serious conse-
quences.

Where certain self-provoked losses
take place, we also very often find
tenderness of the epigastrium when
touched, sensation of faintness,
flatulency, and distention, languor,
palpitation of the heart, pains in the
back and loins, etc. All these are
the results of undue excitement
affecting the central ganglia of the
sympathetic nervous system.

This continued irritation will
almost in every case be com muni-

cated to the spinal cord, causing low-
ness of spirits, pain in the hack and
loins, and local and general pros-
tration ; when repeated shocks take
place, the human frame will not be
enabled to hear up against the con-
tinued losses sustained ; and where
once this artificial irritation exists,
the sympathy will be felt by the
kidneys and bladder, which latter
becomes filled with an unhealthy and
thickened secretion, containing sedi-
mentary deposits, producing reten-
tion and non-retention, with a con-
stant desire to void its contents.

The functions of the brain will
also show that great constitutional
disturbance exists, producing giddi-
ness, headache, bashfulness, hesita-
tion, timidity, involuntary blushing,
etc., memory defective, the mind
wavering, and the power of com-
manding wished-for ideas lost in
vague and unsouglit-for trains of
thought, rendering abortive that
great prerogative of man, his free
will, annihilating at its birth every
high aspiration, which would enable

him to undertake those great and
absorbing projects for which his
spiritual part is so well fitted, when
seeking to draw itself nearer to its
native home by the inspiration of
heaven-born works.

Let man take his lesson in faith
from the wise adaptations of seeming
contradictions, which place before
him unlooked-for effects, seemingly
at variance with the originating
motive ; even death’s lesson is learned
in our night’s repose, and immortality
itself in our dreams, by annihilating
time and space.

Let the reader well consider the
foregoing, and be assured that where
complaints are engendered from
certain habits, that present excite-
ment must be followed by future
prostration. Remember, though the
present may be light, the future will
be dark, whilst the privation of to-
day will bring the rich reward of
to-morrow. He who soweth not too
plentifully, will reap a certain rich
harvest, but he who lavishes his
land unsparingly, may be certain

REWARD OF TEMPERANCE.


that no crop will reward his la-
bours.

Amidst the most important actions
of life, nothing can possibly be more
injurious than that which arises from
too frequent indulgence in the weak-
ening practice acquired in early
youth, fraught in after years with the
most destructive and frightful conse-
quences, dreadful in imagination, and
in its exercise fatal to all present as
well as future happiness ; it lords
itself over every virtue, and is so ty-
rannic in its sway, that becoming
utterly master of all the nobler ener-
gies, the solitary victim once de-
voted to this fatal vortex laments too
late the social compact of reason
and sensibility destroyed, whilst
power declines, and nerveless chilling
apathy succeeds.

The evil consequences are unknown
to many, not even anticipated ; and
should there be some distant forebod-
ing, present excitement banishes the
thought and fear of future sufferings.

The fascination of this unfortunate
delusion most commonly assumes its

sway at a very early period ; tlie
knowledge is frequently propagated
in whispers, or by example from boy
to boy at school, where children
are left, over which the preceptor
can only exercise a limited control,
and there intermix with others
more precocious than themselves,
exposed to numerous temptations,
and requiring more than an ordinary
amount of watchfulness to prevent
the introduction, and afterwards to
eradicate and avert the consequences
of youthful indiscretions. It commits
the most unrestricted ravages ; and it
must he obvious to all, that inasmuch
as it strikes at the very root of
society, at the decrease and deterio-
ration of the human race, (by ener-
vating and debilitating the springs of
life,) disqualifying and impeding man
for the sacred duties of marriage, no
language can he sufficiently strong
in reprobation of the individual,
social, and national miseries resulting
from that practice which is most
odious and hurtful to man, and sinful
in the sight of God.


20


THE LIFE-GIVING FLUID.


Who can doubt of the great
importance of that most essential
fluid in the animal economy ? or feel
the slightest wonder at the amount
of those evils which its imprudent
and unnecessary evacuation is sure
to entail upon those who are addicted
to evil propensities. Where this
is the case, the mind and the body,
sympathising together, experience a
complete exhaustion of their powers :
the intellectual functions of the
former forego their energy, move
with sluggish pace, until at length
they become arrested, and the pa-
tient is plunged into a state of irre-
trievable lethargy. The powers of
the latter are excited by a corre-
sponding impulse, the fluids become
thin, poor, and scanty, circulating
with languid movement, all the
faculties of both become subject to
pain, weakness, and decay. Per-
verted indulgence deadens the desire
for existence, inducing misanthropic
sensations, which absolutely unfit the
sufferer for all the ordinary business
and enjoyments of life ; nay, so


MAN AS A WRECK.


21


absolutely is the victim oppressed by
the wretched infatuation, that while
perfectly conscious of the rapid
change that is taking place, he loses
the moral power of self-control, or
of making the slightest effort to
recover his former position, in order
to reinstate himself among the
fellow-beings of his race. Torn by
the contending passions of remorse
and sensuality, he becomes moody,
unhappy, ferocious, miserable, dis-
trustful, suspicious, gloomy, childish,
or often a strange medley of them
all, presenting in the revolution of
a few brief hours as many aspects of
character as a fickle, uncertain, un-
manly intellect is capable of. He
is led away by an overwhelming
infatuation, which exercises the most
complete tyranny over his reason,
and so becomes aware, that by his
own act, he is self-degraded below
the level of the brute creation.

What is he then ? a secluded, iso-
lated being, only meditating on his
own prurient and diseased fancies.
Once, perhaps, there was the bud-
ding promise of future usefulness

and activity ; now liovv fearfully
changed, the dupe of a desire alike
horrible in imagination as in reality !
The blossom of youth, perhaps
the flower of manhood, the supre-
macy of mind, all gone, degraded,
obliterated. Some continue with
feelings of dismay, having become
conscious of its ruinous tendency,
and though most desirous in conse-
quence to resist, find on seeking
legitimate means, to their deep hor-
ror, that they are strangely and un-
expectedly weak and powerless.

See, then, in this a striking fulfil-
ment of the prophetic warning,
“ There is nothing done in secret
that shall not be revealed, 5 ’ neither
“ hid 55 even from the recognition of
mortals, that shall not ultimately be
made, even to them, evident as the
noon-day. Self-acquired indulgence
entails upon its victims marks as
legible as the scars of small-pox.
How much more closely are these
things perceptible to Him by whom
all actions are weighed — to Him
who knowetli the secrets of * all
hearts, and from whose scrutinising

eye nothing can possibly escape ?
Can we produce a more fearful illus-
tration of the stupefying effects than
is evident in this : that the victim
fears not, in the secrecy of solitude,
when knowingly the gaze of God is
upon him, to do that which, if
caught perpetrating before his fel-
lows, would force him to hide his
head from observation, with confusion
and shame. Dreadful depravity !
strange perversity ! deliberately and
secretly to poison the power of all
manly and natural enjoyment — to
deprive, by a worse than suicidal
madness, the power of judging be-
tween right and wrong — to entail
living misery upon ourselves in this
world, and condemnation in the
next.

Nay, if we reflect ever so super-
ficially on the ordinary laws of God’s
moral government and providence,
— if we think of the natural design
and end of marriage in all countries,
and the way in which it is evidently
intended our species should be pro-
pagated, reason itself would instruct

us, that to destroy that end must be
offensive to God, and unpardonable
against the well-being of society.

We will here give an extract from
a work of the writer already quoted
in these pages — a physician whose
fame has hardly been equalled, and
whose eulogium on the merits of
the Vital Restorative has been, and
will ever remain a lasting authority.
He says in reference to the above
subject : — “ If one of these miserable
cases could be depicted from the
pulpit, as an illustration of the evil
effects of a vicious and intemperate
course of life , it would, I think ,
strike the mind with more terror
than all the preaching in the zvorld.
The irritable state of the patient
leads to the destruction of life, and
in this way, annually, great numbers
perish

The sole remedy universally ac-
knowledged and prescribed through-
out the kingdom by the most
eminent physicians (of London and
Paris), is the justly far-famed Vital
Restorative, being the only one in-

fallible conqueror of nervous and
muscular degeneration, &c. It has
now been successfully administered
in all cases where the vital power has
been found wanting, from various
causes, such as exhaustion, emacia-
tion from the depressing influence
of a tropical sun, enervation from
a luxurious mode of living, or de-
bility and weakness, felt in after
years, consequent on youthful indis-
cretion and inexperience ; also, where
the system has become weakened
from illness, or where the blood has
been impregnated with mercurial
medicines, or tainted by various im-
purities.

In all these several cases its action
is wonderful, yet well known by men
of science (from their analytical and
chemical researches) since possessing
those all-important and necessary
qualities of enriching and purifying
the blood, by producing the red-blood
globules, from whence all the impor-
tant secretions in the human struc-
ture take their source. It will thus
be easily understood how the nrinci-

pal deteriorated secretions become
purified, and of that natural richness
and consistency, imparting strength
and energy to the entire structure,
thereby developing each individual
fibre which make up the muscular
system, and insuring that vigorous
condition, so essential to the well-
being of* man in every stage of life.

Medicines have been brought be-
fore the notice of the public whose
qualities were neither tested by ex-
perience nor practice, but in the case
of the present one, each article con-
tained in this combination is to be
found in the London Pharmacopoeia,
and prepared according to the for-
mulas therein prescribed. The Pro-
fessors of the various Universities
on the continent and in this country,
have submitted the Vital Restora-
tive to every known test, and after
repeated and careful examinations,
have awarded medals and high
honours for its superlative goodness
and unqualified purity and perfectly
uninjurious nature, adapted for the
most delicate constitution, under

every circumstance. What progress
must Chemistry have made in being
enabled to produce so life-restoring
a medicine ! The patronage this
celebrated Vital Restorative enjoys
is not confined to the medical
profession and nobility alone, but
has extended to the Potentates of
the various kingdoms, where the
most eminent Physicians deemed
it a duty incumbent on their pro-
fessional position, not to neglect
making mention of that which
has become known as the greatest
chemical combination for nervous
and muscular debility. Had this
most beneficent medicine contained
that which rendered it for the
time being of importance only, it
would have justified all that has
been spoken in its favour ; but when
it is found to possess, over and above,
properties ( which, like the grafted
flower, becomes part and parcel of
the stem) — when it is found to have
the power of concentrating its vir-
tues, and whilst giving health, still
retaining its own immediate individu-

ality, — then indeed (like the otto of
roses, which, whilst sending forth its
odours, retains its native fragrance),
the Vital Restorative has taken a
place far above all others as “ The
Restorative Once distributed in the
organization, and but one drop re-
maining, its concentrated powers
pervade the entire system, and never
fail to insure those marked curative
and radical changes producing health,
strength, and longevity.

The Vital Restorative acts directly
upon the brain and spinal cord, and
speedily strengthens the whole frame-
work of man, rendering it strong,
and fitted to suit all his wants
and desires. On the main spring
of the watch depends the whole
mechanism ; when left untightened
the action ceases, and the great
work of art is but brass and
steel, useless for its intended pur-
pose. In the same manner when

brain, loses its natural vigorous state,
the muscles become relaxed, and

all intent and purpose like the fallen
oak in the forest. Be-invigorate the
primary motion and sensitive powers,
restore activity to the brain and
spinal cord, and behold the nerves
act on the muscles, the muscles on
the limbs, man once more takes his
erect position, and by his bearing
shows himself lord of the creation,
“ God’s favoured masterpiece.”

Those whose religious feelings tell
them that nothing is created in vain,
will easily understand the necessity
of an antidote for every evil ; and it
would indeed be against the plan of
an all-wise Providence, if so sad a
malady as nervousness had been left
as an exception to the general rule.
That which is most rare has to be
sought for, and when found, like the
diamond, is often valueless, till the
hand of man gives it that polish
which makes it priceless ; thus,
though the ingredients for the cure
of nervousness existed coeval with
man, yet it required the inspiration
of a genius to find and combine them
in such a form as to render it the

greatest blessing to suffering hu-
manity.

The Vital Eestorative may be
considered as one of those discoveries
which immortalize the man, by the
lasting benefit he is allowed to be-
stow on present and future genera-
tions. The impossibility of failure,
the permanency of its action, the
absence of all deleterious drugs,
and its suitability to even the most
delicate constitution, render it in t*he
full acceptation of the words, The
Vital Restorative.

This great medicine, when taken
in the prescribed quantities, braces
without over-stimulating the whole
of the muscular system, gives perma-
nent tone to the nerves, and by its
pure and unadulterated ingredients,
(free from all injurious mineral mat-
ter,) acts directly on the blood,
and by its astringent qualities, re-
stores to their, former state all the
relaxed tissues of the frame, reviving
Nature’s exhausted functions, and
restoring health, nervous and mus-
cular power, and manhood, under

age, nourishing, fertilizing, and
developing every necessary part
of the human organization, thereby
insuring to the mind and heart its
fondest desires.


Having received from Col. J. B. J.
a letter, with statement of case, purely
of a confidential nature, we leave its
contents, and give those of the second,
which will make intelligible that
which the first contained.

“ Gentlemen, — Having told you in
my first letter the cause of my
malady, I need not again recur to
that painful subject. I may now,
however, add a brief account of the
symptoms under which I labour, and
which almost unfit me for the military
duties I have to perform. In the
first place, I suffer from general
prostration of body, seriously affect
ing my mind ; whilst on parade, 1

drums are too much for my nervous
system. I feel pains in the back
and loins, and about the region of
the bladder, also beating at the back
part of my head, and palpitation of
the heart, with a fluttering sensation
in the regions of the chest, particularly
when attempting to trot my horse or
when walking fast, drowsiness whilst
sitting down, but when retiring to rest
a particular and intense watchfulness,
causing in me the desire to rise and
dress. My dreams continue to be
of the nature described in my first
letter, and at times I am even
awakened as much as twice in one
night. I feel dependent on every
thing, and everybody, and society,
which before had great charms for
me, has become to me quite distaste-
ful. These last feelings render me still
more wretched, from family interests
requiring me to enter into the mar-
riage state, which, under existing cir-
cumstances, I dare not contemplate,
it being quite impossible to undertake
those duties which I shall have to
perform. Should it be, as I believe it

health, I shall be most happy to
take every necessary step for that

some speedy relief at your hands,

About five weeks after the follow-
ing letter was received, from which
will be gathered the certainty that
a very short time would be required
finally to restore J. B. J. to as sound
a state of health as he had ever
enjoyed. This case was most inte-
resting, from the length of time the
malady had existed.

“ Gentlemen, — I know not how to
express my gratitude for the immense
benefit derived at your hands, from
the remedies you have sent me ; my
health and strength have been daily

friends ; I know not how to acknow-
ledge the obligation I owe you. I
beg you will forward me another
packet of Messrs. H. & Co.’s Vital
Restorative, which, if equally success-
ful as the last, must, I am sure,
render me quite well. Whilst most
anxiously waiting the further supply,

In all cases of nervous relaxation,
and general and local debility, this
celebrated Vital Restorative finds
its way to the minute distended and
relaxed vessels, nourishing, germi-
nating, and fecundating, whilst com-
mingling with the combined secre-
tions, whilst its astringent qualities
insure the retention of that most
important fluid of the human frame,
which, like the oil in the lamp, feeds
the wick, and lights the flame.

Soon the dormant functions are
awakened, the weakened nerves
strengthened, the relaxed muscles

regain their tension, and lost vitality
is restored in every part of the body,
whilst the secretions of the Vesiculae
Seminalesand Prostate Gland, which
were before scanty, deteriorated, and
of a thin watery nature, become co-
pious, prolific, and of an albuminous
consistency, perfectly adapted for
their reproductive office.

In advanced age, when as a natural
consequence the secretions are more
sparingly elaborated, and in cases of
those whose muscular systems are
but imperfectly developed, and where
power is all but lost, the necessary
physical force is not alone promoted,
but rendered permanent, increased
action is established, and the vigour
of former years restored.

When Messrs. H. & Co.’s Vital
Restorative is taken into the system,
it acts at once upon the spinal cord
and brain, and thence spreading itself
through every part of the body,
causes all the secretions to be in-
creased and the/r quality rendered
prolific, and of a proper consistency
for the due distribution of all

necessary purposes. Innumerable
maladies are at once checked at
their source, whilst the general
health is re-established ; each organ
is rendered capable of performing its
intended office assigned by nature,
and whilst the system is re-invigo-
rated, the flesh regains its firmness,
the muscles their tension, the nerves
their tone, and the blood its original
purity ; new life is felt, and the buoy-
ancy of youth once more raises the
spirits of the before-nervous, pros-
trated, and exhausted.

As the ray of light penetrates
through the smallest crevice, — as
the water soaks through the earth,
and the scent finds its way invisibly
by the olfactory nerves to the brain,
so the celebrated Vital Restora-
tive revives, penetrates, enriches and
vivifies every part of the nervous and
muscular systems, till its purposed
end is attained.

From the absence of all strong
irritants, the nervous system is not
too suddenly roused, but gently
awakened from its lethargy, and the

seemingly imperceptible progress is
rendered certain by its steady action.

One of the many advantages to be
derived from the Restorative, is in its
immediately assimilating with the
food, promoting the secretions neces-
sary for digestion, and every other
vital purpose, enriching the blood, and
by its searching properties re-energis-
ing the whole of the emasculated sys-
tem. Its admixture with the con-
tents of the bladder, kidneys, and
prostate gland, neutralises all sedi-
mentary and unhealthy deposits,
clarifying the clouded and muddy se-
cretions, and restoring the same to its
native, pure, clear, and natural state,
at the same time lubricating and reno-
vating the delicate lining membrane
of the kidneys, and other important
organs. It further restores the mus-
cular fibres when they lose their con-
tractibility, and become flaccid and
pendulous, whilst a distressing sense
of weight is felt, so often described
in homely phrase, as a “ dragging
pain,” mostly brought on in the
first instance by youthful inadver-
tencies, followed by a debilitated state

of mind and body, which, having
drained the fountains of vitality, ter-
minates in enervation, exhaustion,
and total prostration.

To those residing in tropical cli-
mates it becomes indispensable, from
possessing those vital properties
which revive the dormant functions
when relaxed and weakened by
heat, and other causes whose origin
is too well known to require de-
tailed explanation. It is at present
the great reinvigorating panacea,
largely used by the natives of the
East and West Indies, whose re-
ligious and political laws render
them subject to that peculiar state
of mental and bodily incapacity so
prevalent in those countries, as well
as in Turkey and Greece.

Who is there that has not at some
time or other been filled with un-

when ascending some high mountain,

ant sensation which is so often
sought for in vain at the the watering
places of England, and the high-
lands of Scotland, which is now
placed within the reach of all by
the use of the Vital Restorative.
Its all-powerful combination no
sooner becomes absorbed in the
system, than the whole organisation
changes. It neutralises vicious hu-
mours, which, like the stagnant
waters of the pool, breed infection
and disease, but which are by deodo-
risation rendered pure and whole-
some. Nervous complaints, daily
increasing, required an antidote to
meet that self-made scourge of
humanity, and as in the case of small-
pox, no sooner had this last-mention-
ed frightful disease become prevalent
than a Jenner proclaimed to an in-
credulous world that vaccination was
ready to arrest the progress of this
fearful malady.

The Faculty of his time, less liberal
than that of the present, opposed by
every means a remedy which set
aside their services ; but in our days.

UNIVERSAL CELEBRITY.


when the press has the power of
making known every critique and
disquisition on any new and im-
portant discovery, the celebrated
Vital Restorative was at once ac-
knowledged unanimously by all as
the great Reinvigorator of the Nerv-
ous and Muscular Systems ; the readi-
ness of every Academy and Medical
College, abroad and at home, to pro-
claim its marvellous virtues, and the
ratification it received individually
from the profession, by being con-
tinually prescribed in cases where
other medicines have before been
used, has made the Vital Restorative,
like cod livSr oil, chlorodyne, and
other important remedies for cer-
tain special diseases, the only one
that can upon all occasions and
under every circumstance be relied
on, as being safe, certain, and per-
manent.

In taking the Vital Restorative,
the system undergoes a peculiar and
marked change, its powers being di-
rected to those parts which are the
source of action and sensation.


CASE OF 0. J. F.


41


Nothing has tended so much to
the fame of this medicine as its cer-
tain * success in those complaints,
which strike their root so deeply in
the constitution, and are so fatal to
the happiness of mankind. In all
these cases it restores and preserves
the body in health and strength, and
most effectually prevents premature
decay, over and above renovating
the most shattered constitutions at
every period of life in an incredibly
short time.

The following letter will be inte-
resting, by pointing out the advan-
tages to those who, like C. J. F., are
affected by change of climate.

“Gentlemen, — Before coming to
this country my health was very
good; after staying here for about
two years, I began to suffer from
a dull pain in the back, which our
army surgeon pronounced to be
disease of the liver. I had continual
headache, perspired very much,
and had often attacks of diarrhoea,

loins, back, and bladder. Having
been fortunate enough to try some
of your celebrated Vital Resto-
rative, I found myself gradually
improving. I am very desirous of
further strengthening my constitu-
tion, and will, therefore, feel much
obliged by your sending me a five-
pound case, which will be received
and paid for by Messrs. Smith, Elder,
& Co., of Cornhill, who will forward
the same to my address. Requesting
you will not omit an early reply,

The following case, if left to itself,
could not but have terminated fatally,
since its cause had not been treated,
but only the consequences.

The Hon. G- B. P. was a severe
sufferer from nervousness and gradual
decay of strength ; having become
worse, he left for Como. He had
the best advice the place could afford,
but the remedies were powerless

over the malady, which secretly un-
dermined his constitution. It was
at last found necessary to remove
him back to Milan (from whence
he had come). The wasted form
of the once well-formed young
nobleman was most pitiable to be-
hold. The glassy and sunken eyes,
the white but fleshless hands, the
bloodless lips, and many other marked
indications, showed but too plainly
that unless some speedy relief was
found, dissolution would soon follow.
A course of the Vital Restorative
having been fortunately tried, acted
with that success which ever attends
its use. Five weeks had scarcely
elapsed before the Hon. G. B. P. took
his homeward trip in Sir James G.’s
yacht. On his arrival in town, he
expressed himself most gratefully
for the wonderful relief a single
course of the Restorative had af-
forded him, and also for the mode
of living we had prescribed, which
materially hastened his recovery.

been at work, even then the weakened

and debilitated feel its influence, and
all are equally benefited by its rein-
vigorating properties. To man this
great medicine is the anchor of hope,
to which he may safely moor his frail
barque, — the rock upon which he
may build, with the certainty that the
foundation will not give way. Its
power is not lessened by time, nor
weakened by foreign bodies ; on the
contrary, its neutralising powers are
such that, should any injurious medi-
cine have worked ill effects, recourse
to the Vital Restorative will by its
action at once restore to its normal
state the blood and all other secretions,
thereby insuring to the nerves and
muscles their former natural tone and
vigour, the loss of which not only
causes a variety of symptoms, but
diseases, whose termination cannot be
hoped for without some dire calamity.
By its most potent, curative, and
enriching properties, man reduced to
a shadow becomes a substance, and
the living substance, regaining health
and strength, is assured of manhood,
that prerogative without which life

though blessed with all besides.

From numerous letters in our pos-
session, a few only have been se-

limiting their number. For more
detailed and lengthened information,
we must refer the reader to our

subject.

46 LASTING ADVANTAGE THROUGH LIFE.


The virtues of this justly cele-
brated Restorative are daily demon-
strated by the immediate and per-
manent eradication of nervous de-
bility. Its effects are safe, certain,
and lasting, insuring a sound and
robust state of health, wherever a
deficiency of natural vigour has for
years existed.

It is perhaps not generally known
that certain medicines may have the
power of checking disease, which for
the time being may render a patient
satisfied as to his supposed good
state of health, yet make him a
greater sufferer in after years, when
the frame has become less capable
of battling against the increased
evils. W e thus at times see a certain
class of men, who with impunity will
for a time make use of spirituous
liquors, retain a seeming good health,
whilst in reality they are only kept
up by increased stimulants ; these
after a while become subject to
attacks, which mostly terminate in
delirium tremens, owing to their
former intemperance. Thus it is

with those who have taken mercury,
which is unfortunately administered
in this country in very large doses,
and under different names, in order
to mislead those who object to taking
it from personal experience. This
dangerous mineral drug is continually
prescribed, serving its temporary pur-
pose, hut remaining in the system for
very many years after. How many
are there who, having resided in
tropical climates, return to their
native homes with broken constitu-
tic ns, their blood deteriorated and
poisoned by the impregnation of this
noxious mineral, given for liver com-
plaints, and other diseases, who,
had they been treated with a more
safe, yet harmless remedy, might
have looked forward to a green old
age, free from those consequences
which remain as an incubus to mar
their present by fear of the future,
causing pains and swellings of the
bones, sensibility to atmospheric
changes, weakness of the digestive
and other organs, nodes on the shins,

cerated throat, excoriations, erup-
tions, superficial and deep-seated
ulcers, with many other symptoms
that would fill a volume, and cannot
here be mentioned.

A course of the Vital Restorative
neutralises the mercurial poison,
purifies the blood, enriches each
secretion, so that the circulation
becomes freed from all taint, the
muscular and nervous systems are
re-invigorated, the various fluids are
copiously and healthily secreted, in-
suring vigorous development, robust
manhood, and the natural powers of
youth.

As oxygen is necessary to the ex-
istence of man, so assuredly does the
Vital Restorative become indispens-
able to those in ill health ; neither
is capable of being replaced by aught
else. Oxygen supports life, and the
Vital Restorative promotes health
