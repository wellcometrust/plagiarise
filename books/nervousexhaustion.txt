PREFACE.



The following chapters have been written for
tlie purpose of imparting some little information
on subjects of the greatest importance. The
friglitful ravages of Spermatorrhoea, and the
dire effects of Syphilis, are matters which must
almost alarm the calm impartial observer. If
anything can therefore be done to stay the
mighty torrent, he who, having the means at
his command, should neglect to do it would be
criminal. The cause of humanity — of religion
— demands assistance from all who are in a
position to give it. Feeling thisj I have done
what I could.

The following pages are pre-eminently prac-
tical: I am no theorist. To offer theory when
assistance is required is very like giving a stone-
in answer to a rccpiest for bread. Speculation
we have enough of— hypothesis we are nearly-
surfeited with — what we want is something tha t
can be put into practice. I have related my
own medical experience, and narrated cases
that have come under my own observation.

This may seem egotistical, Lut it is the only
true metliod of procedure. Why should I de-
vote my book to what occurred to others ? 1
know nothing of it, except by hearsay. What
I have seen, that I speak of, because that I
know. ISTor have I succumbed to that false
prudery TY-hich is so prevalent in society: I have
disregarded it because I believe it to be mis-
chievous and to have no connection ^\'ith real,
genuine modesty. I have told plain facts, and
those who affect to be shocked at them will only
remind me of the young lady whose modesty
was so great that she could not look at the
noticed truth. My aim is a good one : if men
misinterpret my motive I cannot help it, nor do
I care for what they may say.

But it is now quite unnecessary to make any
apology for publishing a book of this nature.
The importance of the subject on which it
treats has long been recognized by the Pulpit
and by the Press, by the learned and by the
unlearned, by the Medical Profession, and by
their patients. I do not hesitate to assert that
the lessons taught by this little book will prove
of the greatest value to all who study them in
a proper spirit. The laws of the Creator are
absolute and nnchunging ; it is inipossi])le to

do evil or to violate those laws without ill effects
resulting. Health is essential to happiness;
and to enjoy health ^\Q must study the unchang-
ing laws which govern it, and they are not
difficult to understand. Years of experience
have proved that many of the most fatal dis-
eases to which man is suhject arise from unre-
stramed passions and vicious indulgences. ' 'Tho
solitary vice of Self -pollution," says Dr. Wood-
ward, ''spreads desolation through the land."
When we see the miserable victims of an in-
sidious and unsuspected disease slowly but
steadily emaciating ; when we view a series of
phenomena faintly and indistinctly character-
istic of a great variety of disorders, such aa
consumption, wasting away, loss of energy,
physical and mental, and actual brain disease'
can we surrender without remorse— secundum
artem, as it were— the unhappy sufferer to his
fate ? Shall we not rather, despite false deli-
cacy, investigate the origin and causes of such
diseases, and endeavor to determine the true
pnnciples of their cure ? To these investiga-
tions the MICROSCOPE has proved an invaluable
assistance, and the most important recent dis-
coveries are due to its aid. The discovery of
the Spermatozoa and their existence in the



PREFAcr:.



spermatic fluid of all animals, proved that their
presence was essential to reproduction. Hence
a microscopic examination of urethral dis-
charges, or of the urine, furnishes means for a
correct diagnosis of some of the most obscure
cases of spermatorrhea and impotence. The
author takes this opportunity of tendering his
thanks to his numerous friends, patients, and
to the public generally, for the favor with which
his previous works on the subject have been re-
ceived. I have endeavored in this treatise to
give the result of my mature experience in lan-
guage simple and free from technicalities. If
I am successful in warning one who would have
fallen of the fearful consequences of vice ; of
restoring one to hope who had otherwise been
hopeless, this work has not been wntten in
vain. In conclusion, I may observe that those
who wish to apply for advice or assistance may
confulentlv do so without hesitation or difli-
donce: aslhemost timid may rely on my m-
variablv regarding Ih.t inviolable secrecy winch
has alr^adf proved the basis of an extensive
and respectable professional reputation

LECTURE I.

THE ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY OF THE URIN-
ARY AND GENERATIVE ORGANS.

In these days of general education, eveiy man
ought to possess a certain knowledge of the com-
position of his frame, the science known as
Anatomy ; * and also the mode that nature
adopts to carry out the necessities of life, that is
Physiology. The present work being devoted
to the consideration of special maladies, their
causes, prevention, and treatment, it will ho
sutTicient for our object to give a brief and
popular description of the generative organs,
in order that the nature of the diseases may be
fully understood. We are indeed "fearfully

* "Anatomy is llio science of orgauizatiou. Physio-
logy is the science of life."— Kichkrand.

and wonderfully made the great importanco
of the generative organs, and their preservation
in a state of health and vigor, are essential to
well-being, both physical and mental. Their
admirable construction, form, and use are a
striking evidence of skill and contrivance di-
rected to the performance of that most im-
portant function, the reproduction of the species.
The generative organs in man may be divided
into external and internal ; the former consist-
ing of the testicles and penis, and the latter of
the seminal vessels, the urethra, the prostate
gland, &c., with their arteries, veins, nerves, and
lym])hatics. , The urinary organs consist of the
kidneys, ureters, bladder, and urethra. The
kidneys (rcnes) are two glands, in shape rep-
resenting a kidney bean, lying close upon
the muscles of the loins, behind and below the
stomach. It is supposed these organs arc larger
in persons of strong sexual passions than in
those who are less addicted to venerv.

llie Ureters are long tubes, connecting the
kidneys with the bladder, to which they coiivey
the urine sccreied by the kidneys.

TJie Bladder is situated in the lowest ])art of
the body, or pelvi^; it is a muscular bag or
])ouch, and consists of at least three coats or

coTerings. One being composed of muscular
fibres, its contraction causes the expulsion of
the urine. At the neck of the bhidder is a
muscle called the sphincter, by which tlie in-
voluntary flowing away of the urine is prevented.
The chemical composition of urine, in health,
according to recent analysis, is as follows :—

NERVOUS EXriArSTIOIy'.



We direct attention more particularly to this
table, as many diseases, in fact nearly all, change
in some respect the composition of the urine;
and careful analysis enables the medical man
to arrive at a correct diagnosis at an earlv stage
of the malady, •when any mischief may be easi-
ly remedied. In unhealthy urine some one or
other of these substances may be in excess, or
may be altogether wanting. The elements mav
be combined in a manner altogether different ;
or some substance may be eliminated from the
blood and prove a source of considerable danger
to life itself. We have not sufficient space to
enlarge on this subject ; ^ye "will merely refer
to one or two of the most serious of these
diseases. In Diabetes, not only is there an
inmoderate flow of urine, but it is found to
contain a large amount of sugar — so much in-
deed as to be perceptibly sweet to the taste. I'n-
less attended to at an early stage, this disease
is generally fatal. We have saved many valu-
able lives by attending to the indications shown
by the urine at a stage when the disease was
not suspected. Others we have warned, and
not in vain, though at the time it was dilficult
to convince them. One more illustration of the
value of Ihese inquiries. 'J'here is a ilecidedly

marked change in the chemical composition of
the urine when a stone is forming in the blad-
der. For some time previously, a state of health
is indicated which the judicious administration
in remedies may remove, and thus prevent the
necessity of a serious and painful operation.
We may here remark, that an accurate analysis
of the urine is one of the most difficult processes
in chemistry, and can only be performed, with
any approach to correctness, l)y one who is well
versed and constantly engaged in minute in-
vestigations of this kind. It requires, also, one
who has acquired a thorough knowledge of the
microscope, the value of which cannot be over-
rated. For many years the author has availed
himself of this valuable adjunct to diagnosis,
with a success which his attentive practice will
testify.

The testicles (testes) are two glands enclosed
in the scrotum, or purse; they are composed of
a vast number of fine tubes, folded in various
directions, and enclosed by a membrane called
the tunica albuginea. The testicles secrete the
semen, and are supplied with blood from the
vessels which arise from the main arterial trunk,
called the spermatic arteries. The importance
which men attach to the due performance of



u



KERVOUS EXHAUSTION.



the function of these organs is evident from the
number of the suicides caused by their imper-
fection. The testicles are sometimes three in
number, and occasionally there is only one,
though many of the latter cases prove, on exami-
nation, to be a retention of the testicle in the
abdominal canal. A young man -who had been
ordered a truss for a supposed rupture, consulted
ns; Ave found the case was simply one of reten-
tion of the testicle. Had the truss been applied,
he might have been lamed for life.

The Seminnl Ca ?ials {Yasa, Deferentia), which
ascend on each side from the upper part of the
testicle, accompany the spermatic artery, vein,
and nerves, and are together called the Sjjermatic
Cord. The seminal bladders (vesiculT) are at
the upper part of the bladder, and are considei-ed
to be the reservoirs for the semen. They also
secrete a peculiar fluid, which is added lo the
semen in the act of coition. The prostnte gland
is in front of tlje seminal bladder; in sluipc ;ind
size it somewhat resembles a chestnut. Tin-
fluid wliich it secretes is of a cream color, and
serves to lubricate the surface of the urctlira,
along which the semen has to })ass. The prostate
gland is subject to disease and relaxation, and
when this is the case the act of copulation is



^'ERVOUS ExHAUStlON.



15



nnBatisfactory and even painful. We have
frequently been consulted in cases where there
has been a continuous discharge from this gland;
the semen is then emitted by the slightest
effort, more especially during sleep; this has
often been the cause of wasting away, strophy,
or consumption. Many surgeons have treated
these cases as venerial, and their inexperience
has proved most injurious. The microscope
here lends its valuable aid. The penis is divided
into the root, the body and the glands. The
spongy substance which forms the glans penis
is covered with a thin membrane, tinder which
are placed very sensitive nervous papilla% which
are the chief cause of the pleasure in coition.
Many in the venerial act have not the glands
distended, which arises fi-om a weakened state
of the cavernous body of the urethra. When
this is the case from Onanism, or other causes,
impotence will arise; Avhich, unless its cause be
perfectly understood, cannot be cured by any
physician.

The -glans is protected by the prepuce, or
foreskin. In healthy men, at the moment be-
fore the semen is ejected, the glans and whole
body of the penis arc extremely rigid; soon after
a convulsive motion follows, the semen is dis-



16



NEKVOUS EXHAUSTION.



charged by a reflex action, and there is a slight
loss of strength throughout the body, which
however soon recovers tone. But the erection
of the penis may also be produced by mechani-
cal irritation, as friction of the glans of the
prepuce, caused by a distended bladder, as
evinced in the morning after a night's rest,
also by tumors or stone in the bladder. This
highly complicated and delicate organism, of
which we have given a brief outline, is entirely
subservient to the proper secretion and ejection
of the Semeis".

The semen is a thick whitish fluid, with a pe-
culiar odoriferous smell; it consists of the
liquor seminis and certain solid particles. The
liquor seminis is colorless, transparent, and
albuminous, and contains, floating in it, two
principal constituents, viz., spermatozoa and
seminal granules. The microscope must here
be called into requisition. Tlie spermatozoa
are living bodies or animalcula, existing in very
considerable numbers in liealtliy semen. They
are also found in the urim^, but lu^ver excepting
the g-euerativo oro:ans have become weakened
by Onanism or excesses.

The animalcula are formed like a tadpole,
witli a round head or body, and a narrow tail;

17



they move with great rapidity, and their length
is abo^at a six-hiindreth to a thousandth part of
an inch.

"Wagner has shown that they are developed
within cells, and originate from the spermatic
grannies, being formed by the dispersion of the
nuclei of tliese cells. Their original discovery
is due to Lowcnhoeck, in 1607. The animalcula
are not found in the fluid contained in the
seminal organs before puberty, but they are
always present afterwards; nor do they disap-
pear while the power of j^rocreation is retained.
But when the semen is diseased by the debility
of the parts, their number becomes fewer, until
at last they almost disappear. There is no doubt
that the animalcula are essential for the im-
pregnation of tlie ovum in the female, but all
our ingenuity and research have been vainly
exerted in the attempt to unravel the mysterious
process of conception. Life and organization
are neither inseparal)lc nor even identical. Man
is still ignorant how life begins or ceases. "We
must turn to the Creator of all things, and
though wo can explain tlie structure, the primal
cause is beyond all human reason.



PHYSIOLOGY OF MARRIAGE.

The sacred ordinance of marriage emanates
from the Deity, by whom we are enjoined to
"increase and multiply," — hence it is consider-
ed honorable amongst all men, and should not
he entered upon carelessly or Avantonly, nor
without duly considering the causes for which
it was originally ordahied. Marriage was intro-
duced l)y the Divine Creator, in the time of man's
primitive innocence, as the means of his happi-
ness and the perpetuation of his race. Its in-
fluence extends from individuals to kingdoms,
and to the whole world. Jeremy Taylor calls
it "the 'mother of the world, Avhich preserves
cities, and fills cities, churches, and even heaven
itself." It is the primitive source of morals
and society, the nurse of virtue and patriotism,
the stay and support of governments. In a word .
no other social institution exercises so profound
an influence on the well-being of society. The
obligations of marriage are mutual and impera-
tive; if any deception is practised, those culpable
will sooner or later receive punishment in the
disappointment of their pleasure, the loss of tlieir

health, and the remorse oJ; tlieir o^\■n reflections.
It unfortunately liappcus — in (he present arti-
lleial state of society — that many men are unable
to marry before middle life, perhaps after a you tlx
spent in more or less dissipa(;ion— perliaps after
having acquired the seeds of disease and impo-
tence. The question then arises— Is such a man
capal)le of procreating healthy children, or of
satisfying those desires inplanted by nature in
the most modest and virtuous of women, not less
strongly tlum in man himself? The conscious-
ness of deliciency must cause any man to feel
abashed, and he can offer no excuse but what
must tend to lessen the love and respect of liis
wife. Ignorance— of a density unequalled, of an
obstinacy unparelleled— long prevailed on the
topics Avhicli control most completely the fitness
of men and women for wedlock. Tliere arc
certain stages of injured health, capable, by
early and skilful treatment, of thorough a,nd
speedy cure; but which, if neglected,' or in-
judiciously dealt with, render aught but disgust
and misery in marriage a thing humanly impos-
sible.^ No man is so likely to be jealous as the one
that is conscious that his wife has just reason for
complaint; and no wonum is so likely to go astray
as one who is tantalized by the abortive toying



20 NERVOUS EXIIAUSTJOX.

of an inipotent husbund. We admit nothing can
justify a Avifc in proving false to the marriage
vow, and nothing can ever after restore her to
the position of a virtuous woman; but cases fre-
quently occur where much might be urged in
extenuation, and M'here he who is considered the
injured husband is in reality more guilty than his
wife. Women were formed to complete the well-
being of man, and those who abstain from inter-
coui-sc with them arc rarely either happy or
healthy. Marriage constitutes the bond of so-
ciety, and the respect paid to its ordinances
affords the best test of the moral condition of
i). civilized people; but where generative weak-
ness exists, let not the unhappy sufferer augment
his own misery by the sacrifice of one from
whom he can expect nothing but dislike, re-
]iroaches and contempt, and whose happiness may
thus be marred. It may be safely affirmed, that
a difference of temperament between married
persons is conducive not only to mutual affec-
ti(m but to fertility. Nature appears to desire
marriages between differentfamiliesand nations,
because such crossings of the various races im-
prove and invigorate the species. Humboldt
and others have observed that the offspring of
Europeans and >:iliiopcans arc peculiarly robust



NERVOUS EXHAUSTIOSr,

and active. From numerous observations of a
similar nature, he argues that the best mode of
eradicating hereditary diseases, gout, scrofula,
consumption, epilcps}', madness, etc., in their
early tendency, is by tlie commixture of the spe-
cies in intermarriage, Avhich often prevents the
transmission of disease to the next generation.
The mental weakness, as well as mean appear-
ance, of some of the European royal families is
strongly colirmatory of the truth of these prin-
ciples. Walker, in his admirable and interesting
work " On Intermarriage," proves beyond the
possibility of cavil, that insanity, idiocy, and
numerous physical ailments occur four times
above the average in tlie offspring of "famihj
marriages^' AVhen persisted in for some genera-
tions, the race usually becomes extinct. Nor is
this confined to man alone — the rule extends
from man downwards, through the whole realm
of animated nature.

The essentials of reproduction on the male
side are a healthy condition of the whole gen-
erative system: the erection of the penis should
be perfect, maintcnant and vigorous, and the
secretion and emission of the semen obedient
to the command. On the part of the female,
the generative organs should be sensible of the



22



NEHVOUS EXHAUSTION.



approaching impulse; the best test of their
healthy state is the presence of desire, and the
enjoyment of the orgasm simultaneously with
the male. Instances of generative incapacitj",
local weakness, and utter impotence are very
numerous. Again, it is no uncommon circum-
stance for a man on his approach to a female,
with a view to sexual commerce, though he
may possess all the confidence necessary, to find
the tone of his inclination suddenly leave him,
and to observe a seminal discharge almost im-
mediately on contact, or even before; the de-
sign is, of course, frustrated, at least for some
time, and he has to endure the double mortifi-
cation of incurring and giving disappointment.
Another frequent deficiency is an insuficieutly
lasting erection, which prevents the mechanical
irritation requisite to excite the proper action
of the seminal vessels. Other persons possess
both desire and capability, but at very consider-
able intervals — a sure sign of approaching decay.
Occasionly, from disease, or from ^vant of exer-
cising the generative functions, men may be
found where the organization is perfect (though
the development is rather smaller than usual),
yet where there is a total inaptitude, or, at all
events, a complete distaste for sexual intercourse.



Sucn cases are curable without mucli diUiculty.
lu the early stages of seniiual weakness, differ-
ent persons are variously affected; some are in-
capable of procuring a discharge of the semen
into the cavity of the female genitals in a
natural way, though they may effect temporary
erection; while others cannot perform -the act of
copulation, from emission taking place too
quickly, and before the proper firmness of the
male organ has enabled it to effect the requisite
penetration. What man, possessing the ordi-
nary feelings of a man, can contemplate with-
out a shudder these terrible consequences of
self-indulgence? The nuptial bed of such an one,
instead of teeming Avith a hallowed, ecstatic and
transporting delight, is converted into a scene
of blended mortification, disgust, disappoint-
ment, and suppressed anger; and it is now that
the mistaken bride is made to feel herself the
victim of previous sensuality — the poor, deceiv-
ed, last hope of vigor — anxious for offspring,
yet baffled from day to day in the arms of the
man she has vowed at the altar to love and
honor; and he, conscious of the cause of his
infirmity, the dark secret smouldering in his
breast, galling his Avretched existence, and not
to be imparted even to the wife of his bosom.



NERVOL'3 EXnAUSTION".



A gentleman recently wrote to us in the follow-
ing powerful langtuige: — " Dear Sir, — You arc
the first to whom I have plucked up resolution
to open my case; I fear it is beyond even yotir
skill, hut,, for heaven's sake, give it your careful
consideration, and above all, let me have your
candid opinion; I shall then know how to act.
My age is 2d; I have practised self-pollution,
when a hoy, some years, indeed to a very recent
period. i married a beautiful young woman
three months ago. I experienced an excitement
most powerful, my passion was most vehement,
and I attempted the sexual act. Immediately
a spontaneous emission occttrred, the excitement
left me, and my emotions and desires became
palsied. My system became utterly incompetent
to manly orVigorous health. That is tlie history
of my fii-st attempt, and of every succeed ing trial
If you can assist me I shall be grateful for life.
My wife bears with me with angelic patience, but
I cannot long endure my i.n-esent wretchedness.'"
In a letter a few months later, this gentleman
^•i-ites:— "My Dear Sir.— Words fail to express
iny gratitude for your skill and kindness. I am
happy to inform you that my dear wife is now
enceinte. This "l am aware will not surprise
vou: but I cannot forbear writing to express



IsERVOUS EXIIAUSTIOIy.



25



my gratitude. My dear wife also desires to be
most kindly remembered."

That the liappiness of married life may in a
great measure be secured or defeated by atten-
tion to, or neglect of, Avliat lies in our power
previous to its consummation, is as true as that
there are duties obligatory alike upon man and
wife after marriage. If a man has made a hasty
or thoughtless selection, the fault is assuredly
his own. Although it, cannot be doubted that
warm and mutual affection is an essential con-
dition to niarried felicity, it must be remember-
ed that passion is a false and treacherous guide,
when not founded on well-merited and well-
defined respect. It is often inquired, what is
the proper age to enter the marriage state ? and
the question is one that is difdcult to answer.
Much depends upon individual health and tem-
perament; but as a general rule, we find the
happiest unions, and also the most fruitful,
when the man marries from the age of twenty-
five to thirty-five, and the woman is from five
to seven years younger. Dr. Samuel Johnson
observes : ' ' Those wlio marry at an advanced age
will probably escape the encroachment of their
children; but, in diminution of this advantage,
they are likely to leave them, ignorant and help-



26



NEliVOUS KXHAU8T10K.



less, to a guardiaivs mercy; or, if that should
not happen, they must at least go out of the
world before they see those they love best either
wise or great. " It is quite certain that on young
women marriage will frequently have a most
beneficial effect. Hysteria, ISTervousness, Irregu-
laritiy, sometimes even Consumption, are known
to disappear after marriage. In reference also
to the male sex, it is quite certain that, in-
depently of many morbid affections and habits
which marriage removes, it augments the energ}-
of the system of the blood vessels; the distended
arteries, pulsating with greater force, transmit
warmth and animation throughout the body;
the muscles become more vigorous, the step
more elastic, the voice firmer, every physical
attribute of humanity becomes boldly developed.
Marriage, however, is not altogether made up
of "sighs and wreathed smiles;" though" it has
its devotions, it has also its obligations; and the
divine command, "increase and multiply," can
only be obeyed by those in the full possession of
mental and bodily vigor. Even under the most
favorable circumstances of youth and vigor, it
is necessary to Avarn the newly-married couple
of the danger of excessive indulgence, which
injures the health of women, and by causing

many painful disouses, soon rendei-s intercourse
utterly repugnant. It also prevents or impairs
the oiSspring — for whatever enfeebles or diseases
the sexual organs must of necessity have that
effect. Temperance in the connubial embrace,
as in all other things, is the medium which we
should observe and recommend. The following
case will illustnite some of the dangers to which
we have referred: — A¥. S. called upon us for
consultation early in June, 18G2. Ilis ago was
about twenty-five, and his occupation salesman
in a dry-goods house. He had been always very
regular in his habits, had never been guilty of
Onanism, nor of illicit connection. His frame
was rather delicate, and liis temperament nerv-
ous-sanguine. About ten months previously he
had married a young widoAV, and for about six
months he indulged very freely in the pleasure
of the marriage-bed, without feeling any bad
effects. About that time, however, he began to
lose flesh very perceptibly, and to feel great
lassitude on the least exertion. Ilis appetite
failed — his sleep became disturbed and unre-
freshing — his bowels constipated; in short, all the
symptoms proved a general failure of health.
Added to this, his sight became impaired, and
also his memory — he lost energy and spirit, and



38



KERVOUS EXHAUSTION.



his daily occupation was a trouble to him. He
now began to complain of pain in the upper
part of the right lung, and considerable diffi-
culty in breathing; and soon began to spit blood,
of bright red color and frothy appearance. Be-
coming seriously alarmed, and suspecting that
his illness was caused by excessive indulgence,
he called upon us for advice. On examining hi.s
chest, I observed some dullness on percussion
in the upper portion of the right lung, imme-
diately under the clavicle; the respiratory mur-
mur was also absent from this part — in other
respects the lungs seemed all right. The action
of the heart was somewhat irregular, being very
much hurried from a slight cause. Of course,
it was essentially necessary that he should ab-
stain from all sexual intercourse; medicine was
prescribed suitable for the case, and within a
month he began to recovei' strength — the pul-
monary s\'mptoms gradually declined, and per-

there is anything to be set right before the mar-
riage is consummated. Much misery, perchance
innocent lives may he spared by attending to
this obvious and easy duty. Sometimes an old
venerial contamination may be lingering in the
blood. Careful examination and analysis will
decide; and treatment for two or three weeks
may prevent long years of unhappiness.

In concluding this part of my subject, I may
be allowed to observe that it is right and useful
that all men should know that there are prin-
ciples of personal management which cannot be
violated without the incurral of grievous penal-
ties; it is right that they should know, when
wisdom and regret succeed the heyday of incon-
siderate self-indulgence, how these penalties
may be mitigated, and how the sting of their
remorse may be ultimately removed. The mo§t
absurd of all emotions is that of despair. Let
the sufferer remember that there is scarcely any
degree of weakness or functional derangement
to which the timely aid of science cannot apply
a cure.



LECTUEE III.



ONANISM, OR SELF-POLLUTION.

Manustrapsio, Masturbation, the Sin of Onan,
are the names commonly given to this pernicious
habit, which may be defined a discharge of the
semen by the stimulus of the virile organ with the
hand ; the habit (it is said) of the solitary monk
and recluse, as well as of inconsiderate youth,
and too often of those whose riper years should
prevent their guilty indulgence in an act so re-
volting to humanity, and so destructive to every
sentiment and feeling of vigorous manhood"!
Tf we refer to the opinions expressed by the
most celebrated physicians amongst the ancients
or modems, we find a remarkable uniformitv
in their opinions on this subject. Cclsus remarks,
"These habits are always hurtful, and indulgence
in them weakens the strongest constitution."
Galen gives a corresponding account of the evils
caused by this vice. The late 'Sh: Benjamin
Bell, the eminent surgeon, of Edinburgh, also,
in reference to the effects of this indulcrence.
says, — "A habit so baneful to many of our
youth, that I believe it to be more destructive
in its effects than a greater proj)ortion of all the

diseases to which in early life they are liable."
Besides rendering the patient himself miserable,
it evidently entails the seyerest distress upon
posterity by generating languor, debility and
disease, instead of that strength of constitution,
without which there can be no enjoyment.
Lalleniand remarks, — "Our lunatic asylums
alford many instances of insanity produced by
this detestable practice. " Nocturnal pollutions,
or "wet dreams" are in most cases brought
on by Onanism. After a short period has
elapsed, the nocturnal are now conjoined with
diurnal pollutions; the semen passes off in the
urine, or at stool, without sensation, and there-
fore unmarked by the patient. It therefore be-
comes a problem of the greatest interest and
importance, if there be any means by which the
presence of spermatozoa, or the living j^rinciplo
of the seed, may be detected with certainty. We
have introduced into our practice the use of the
microscope,^ which for the purpose of diagnosis
is absolutely indispensable. By the examination
of a small quantity of the matter or discharge
from the urethra, or by the microscopic observa-
tion of the urine we are enabled to decide wii,h
certainty as to the presence or absence of the
seminal fluid, and, consequeutly, ou the neces-

sary treatment required b}- ilio ease. A gentle-
man called upon us in September, 186(3, aged
27. He stated he had been induced to consult
us, owing to having observed some yellow-color-
ed stain upon his linen. He had been treated
for nearly a month for gonorrhoea; but finding
himself get worse instead of better, had called
for our opinion. We carefully examined the
discharge, and also the urine, by means of the
microscope, and irnmediately detected a great
loss of semen in the urine, and that the matter
consisted almost entirely of the seminal fluid.
On inquiry he admitted, though with great
reluctance, that he had been in the habit of
practising Onanism. A proper course of medi-
cine was administered, and in four or five weeks
he was entirely well.

It frequently occurs, as a result of self-pollu-
tion, more especially when practised in early
youth, that the testicles do not attain their full
size and powers of secretii\g semen. This state
has been termed ''an arred of drvdopwnit,'' a
phrase which simply means iluit tlie organs have
ceased to grow at a period of life ]n-evious to
puberty. We have seen the case of a gentle-
man, aged 28, whose penis and testicles were
not larger than those of a boy ten years old.



NERVOUS EXHAUSTIOX.



33



Other cases of a similar charactpr have also
presented themselves to our notice. Such in-
stances are not beyond the influence of medicine,
unless when they occur in the persons of idiots.
Wasting or diminution in the size imd powers
of the organs may occur at any age. The
testicle may retain its proper shape though
diminished in size; it feels soft to the touch,
and loses its elasticity and firmness. In texture
it is pale, and the blood-vessels seem diminished
in number, the spermatic cord becomes affected
by the disease, the nerves shrink, and the
cremaster muscle disappears. The thin gelatin-
oTis semen which is formed is entirely devoid of
spermatic granules and spermatozoa. In other
Avords, its fertilizing power is lost, and impuis-
sance gradually results. AVhen disease is the
cause of the atrophy, the testicles may alter in
shape — become uneven and irregular— some-
times elongated as well as diminished in size and
weight. There is one form of disease which
frequently precedes the decay of the organs, and
which is seldom ol^served by medical men— a
low inflammation, quite painless, acts upon the
testicle, and gradually increases the bulk, at the
same time diminishing the firmness and consis-
tency; in some instances the testicle almost feels



34



NERVOUS EXHAUSTIOX,



as if dividing. On inquiring into the origin of
these cases, we frequently find that a swelled
testicle (hernia humoralis) has existed, caused
by gonorrhcBa. Hence the necessity of curing
urethral discharges as rapidly as possible, and
the care required in the use of astringent in-
jections. Injuries of the head, more especially
the back part of the head, have been known to
produce decay of the testicle; and this fact may
tend to support the theory of the phrenologist
that the seat of amatory passions is in the cere-
bellum. Doubtless the brain exercises great in-
fluence on the desire for sexual intercourse, and
it is equally certain that there is a reciprocal
action of the generative organs upon the brain.
Such is the similarity of structure of the brain
and the testicle, and so great the sympathy be-
tween them, that an extensive experience during
many years has proved that in some instances
a species of derangement is caused by diseases
of the generative organs. It is chiefly on tlio
youth of both sexes that self-pollution commits
most ravages. This is so much more to be deplor-
ed, as it thus strikes at the very root of society,
and has a direct and immediate tendency to des-
troy it, by enervating and debilitating, almost
from their very cradle, those whom nature's

God intended as best adapted to preserve and
adorn it. How many of the debilitated and ema-
ciated objects daily present themselves to our
view, with pallid and haggard countenances and
sunken eyes, who are indebted solely to the
abominable act of masturbation for this wretched
state of debility and exhaustion ? Disabled from
rendering service either to themselves or friends,
they drag on a life totally useless to others
and a burden to themselves, in the midst of
society in which they are despised. A frequent
cause of the practice of Onanism is ignorance
of the enormity of the crime, a crime, of which
an eminent divine has written: — "In itself it is
monstrous and unnatural— in its practice filthy
and odious to extremity — its guilt is crying and
its consequences ruinous — it destroys all con-
jugal affection— prevents natural inclination —
and tends to extinguish the hopes of posterity."

There are thousands among the youth of both
sexes— ingenuous, docile, diligent, and tractable
—who, either from example or from accident,
have thus learned this vice, Avho would have
abhorred the thought, had they understood the
nature of the sin, and been made acquainted
with its fearful results. As connected with this
subject, we may here observe that anything like



;g§ NERVOUS EXHAUSTION.

attempted concealment respecting it is a practi-
cal injury to morality. The Book of books it-
self is not only standing evidence of the heinous-
ness of "the sin of Er and Onan,'' hnt of tlie
necessity of proclaiming it to all mankind. Their
sin was committed in the full con.sciousness of
its inherent hatefulness, and therefore their
punishment was most signal. Their example has
been left on record as a feakful wakxing to
FUTURE C4ENERATI0NS; as a measure of the de-
pravity of certain transgressions, and the inevit-
able certainty of retributive justice. Anotlier
cause of self -pollution is the secrecy with which
it maybe committed; all other actions of nn-
cleaniiness must have a witness, this needs none.
Again, the laws against adultery, though in many
cases inoperative, are sufficient to deter many;
whereas in self-pollution neitlier the cautious
nor tlie covetous imagine they have anything
to fear. How strange it is that a man should
show bashfulness and the utmost cowardice to
liis fellow-creature (even shouhl that fellow-
creature be the most impotent wretch) and that
he should behave with gigantic boldness and
impudence to the Almighty Creator of heaven
and earlli. The most experienced medical practi-
tioners are of opmion that the development of

the nervous system, and the predominance of its
action over the otlier parts of the organism, are
• also amongst the causes of masturbation. We
comparatively seldom see this habit indulged in
by robust and vigorous persons, whose muscular
and digestive organs are in full development;
they are generally more disposed to exercise their
limbs, as well as their appetite for the pleasure
of the table, in which their minds are too much
engaged to allow them to addict themselves to
indulgences in other gratifications. This ex-
cessive development of nervous sensibility, which
IS the source of so many praiseworthy actions,
as well as of so many vicious enormities, and
which, according to the directions it receives,
gives rise to the most splendid or to the
basest of results, may be derived either from
natural disposition or from early education. It
is immediately after early infancy, at that epoch
when the faculties of the new being commence
to be developed with energy, that he runs the
greatest danger. If then an unfortunate accident,
or, as too frequently happens, the indelicate
touches of strange hands, disclose to the young
subject what may at this time be considered a
new sense, there takes place at this period to-
wards the genital organs a greater or less con-

ceutration of tlic vital forces, aiicl the patient,
led on by the delusive pleatiure, gives himself up
with fury to a vice Avhich is sure soon to destroy
him, or draw down on him evils more terrible
than death itself. Another most dangerous pe-
riod of life is the approach of puberty, which
varies in this climate from the age of eighteen
to twenty-two. The rapid growth of the genera-
tive organs — the increased power and frequency
of erection— the rapid secietion of semen — all
lead to the performance of that act Avhich is
sure to occasion the deepest remorse. It is the
attentive consideration of these varied facts
which explains to us how, the habitual exercise
of the genital organs, either by coition or mastur-
bation, may so far get the better of the will of the
individual as to force him to indulge in practices,
the object of which is to gratify the venerial stim-
ulus. In almost all such cases the shameful act
when finished, is invariably followed by bitter
regret; but as the organs obtain repose, the
resolution which he had adopted, of relinquisli-
mg the baneful practice, and which he had
thought nothing could shake, are soon for-
gotten. We have frequent ly heard patients ex-
claim: "Oh! how often and often have I solemn-
ly sworn never again to pollute myself, and how



NERVOUS EXHAUSTION".



39



often have I promised myself, when in the act,
that it should be for the last time." We implore
those who have addicted themselves to this
ruinous and suicidal habit not to rely on their
own resolution — not to depend on their oAvn firm-
ness and fancied strength of mind; let them ap-
peal to Higlier Aid— and, above all, let them
prayerfully avoid temptation.

If we compare the injurious effect of exces-
sive indulgence in coition and tliose of mastur-
bation, we shall find that the causes wliich com-
bine to render excess in the former dangerous
act with much more energy in the second, aud
that several circumstances peculiar to the latter
render the results of its frequent repetition more
serious. It isAvcll knoAvn that the man who ad-
dicts himself to the solitary and debasing prac-
tice of Onanism is kept for a considerable time
in a state of general and permanent rigidity of
the entire l)ody; this state of tension is sometimes
carried so far tliat veiy painful cramps are caused
by it, and tlie fatigue Avliich results obliges the
patient to relax his efforts occassionaly to take -
rest. It is sufficient to observe the circumstances
which accompany masturljation to see that the
nervous system must l)e directly affected by it,
not only from the violent and continued oon-

tractions wliicli it occasions throughout the en-
tire muscular system, but also by the prodigious
tension of the imagination, wliich is in cases
wound up to its highest state, in order to repre-
sent to the devoted votaries of self-pollution the
fantastical object of their disgusting transports.
Another cause which renders Onanism more
dangerous than excessive indulgence in coition
arises from the circumstance that it is much
easier to addict one's self to the one than to
abuse the other; for when a man gives himself
up to the natural pleasures of love, the fatigue
felt, as Avell by his companion as by himself, will
have the effect of preventing his exhaustion;
whilst on the other hand there is no bridle, no
restraint on him who practises self-abuse; the
former is in general obliged to wait for a favor-
able moment and opportunity to indulge in his
excess — every momeni answers the purpose of
the latter— all he requires is mere solitude. He
constantly carries about him the sting which
torments him; he alternately finds his imagina-
tion exciting his organs, and his organs inilam-
ing his imagination. In short, there is nothing
to distract or take up the attention of one who
has addicted himself to Onanism, whilst a
thousand circumstances are constantly distract-



NERVOUS EXHAUSTION".



41



ing the attention of the man who is disposed for
the enjoyment of a female. Another serious
danger in this vice is the period of life when
persons addict tliemselves to it; we have occa-
sionally met with it in quite young children, most
frequen'fly amongst full-grown boys and young
men, for the va,rious difficulties and impediments
which prevent copulation before a certain age
do not exist in the case of Onanism — thus the
generative propensity, called forth prematurely,
and gratified viciously, steps in amidst all the
natural efforts of growth, with its unnaturul
train of moral excitations, sensual shocks, and
physical pollutions. No wonder that the Father
of Medicine should notice its effects, thus iEtius
gives the following description: " Young people
have the air and appearance of old age ; they
become pale, effeminate, lazy, benumbed, stupid
and imbecile; they have a total distaste for every-
thing, are totally incapacitated, and may even
become paralytic." In short, when we look upon
the horrible consequences resulting from this
practice, are we not justified in regarding it as
a lingering moral and physical suicide ?

As we have intimated, the practice of Onanism,
when once indulged in, is difficult to abandon;
the patient is perhaps for years unconscious of any



43

change, and no one part of the body feels weak-
ened more than another; but there gradually
comes over a creej)ing languor, a want of energy,
a sensation of lassitude, a depression of spirits,
ennui, and a disinclination for society; these
feelings at length increase so as to at%-act the
attention of the patient and his friends. He
and they are sensible that he is not what he
formerly Avas; his face becomes pallid, the circles
around the eyes depressed and darkened, a thin-
ness is visible in his looks, his hands are fre-
quently cold and clammy, he cannot bear the
cold he was Avont to do, his old pursuits have
no attractions for him, nor do any new ones
attract his attention; his memory becomes im-
perfect, his vision is not so clear, nor his sight so
strong, as formerly; morbid sensations annoy
him; at length he sinks into fatuity, and either
is carried off by some rapid decline, or hastens
liis end by laying violent hands on himself.
(Such is the history of many cases of suicide of
which we read in the newspapers. The follow-
ing, illustrating many of the above features, is
from the work of the celebrated French physi-
cian, Tissot: —

about this period the evil example of a youthful
companion initiated liim in the liabit of self-
abuse, which he repeated daily, even to the ex-
tent of two or three times, and until the seminal
emission was followed l)y a sliglit insensibility,
and a complete prostration of mental and bodily
strength; this warning was insufficient to rescue
him from his disgusting practices; and the repe-
tition of them became more frequent, till he was
in a state which gave reason to apprehend a fatal
termination. Too late a penitent, he had become
incurable, and the generative oi-gans were so
weakened that the slightest irritation caused a
partial erection, with an immediate emission of
seed, which of course i ncreased his Aveakness, and,
becoming incapacitated, he was obliged to re-
linquish his business. Thus, overwhelmed with
misery and disgrace, he pined for some months
without assistance, with the agonizing reflection
that he himself was the cause of his awful situa-
tion. I Avas called upon to attend him, and found
him past recovery; he Avas meagre, pale, and al-
most incapable of moving; a palish Avatery matter

from the mouth; he Avas alfccted Avith diarrhoea,

cians, Avho Iuxa'c deA'otcd tlieir lives to the in-

thanks to the important discoveries in chemistry
and to the light thrown on the cause of disease
l^y the use of the microscope, Ave have not often
presented to us cases so desperate as the above.
Indeed, during my long experience and ex-
tensive practice, I may assert, without hesita-
tion, that no one patient has left my charge
without having derived immense benefit from
my treatment; and many cases, apparently hope-
less, where my patients have been far gone in
consumption, where the vital energy has been
reduced to the lowest ebb, where generative de-
bility and impuissance have existed for years,
have been restored, under Providence, by my
remedies to health, strength and manhood.

Still it is difficult to depict a more truly miser-
able being than the slave to licentiousness. His
imagination burning with filthy, unnatural
glow; his bodily organs taxed to the utmost,
weary and jaded, refuse to obey the stimulus
of that never-slumbering depravity which goads
his fancy in the darkness of night, in the dreams
of his broken rest, and in the worse than dreamy
abstractions of the cheerless day ; he is tormented
with desires he can never gratify, shut out from

flower of manhood) the supremacy of mind, all
degraded, obliterated, gone ! Let not the in-
tensely prurient, yet seeming modest victim of
self-pollution lay the flattering unction to his
soul that from the eye of his fellow-mortals lie
can conceal his unmanly practices. It is written
upon his forehead; the physiognomy, that faith-
ful mirror of the soul and body, gives clear indi-
cation of the internal disorder. The complexioii
and plumpness which jointly confer a youthful
look, and which is the sole substitute for beauty
— for Avithout this even beauty produces no other

plumpness are the things that fij-st disa])]ieai-; a

nothing done in secret that shall not be reveal-

therefore raise our testimony against these vices?
Sir Astley Cooper justly remarks in one of his
lectures: " If one of these miserable cases could
be depicted from the pulpit as an illustration
of the bad effects of a vicious and intemperate
course of life, it would, I think, strike the mind
with more terror than all the preaching in the
Avorld. The irritable state of the patient leads
to the destruction of life, and in this way, an-
nually great numbers perish. Undoubtedly, the
list is considerably augmented from maltreat-
ment, and the employment of injudicious reme-
dies." And the late learned Dr. Pcrcira, Avhose
abilities as a practical pliysician Avere only

knowledge of human nature, observes, in review-
ing "Nervous Exhaustion," — "There is a

morals, but to the indivicliial health, by the
abuses and excesses of the reproductive func-
tions; the primitive fathers and physicians have
duly noticed the evils to which I allude, and
every experienced medical practitioner can attest
their frequent occurrence. It is all very well for
sentimentalists and the mock-modest to declaim
about the notice of them; but justice, morality,
and the preservation of health, as well as the
perpetuation of the human race, demand it.
Such, however is the hyprocrisy of the day, that
even a notice in a dead language is abused and
condemned by the ignorant and intolerant, Avho
are unable to appreciate the importance of the
subject. This is a bold step in the right direction."

'Nov are the evils of self-pollution confined to
the male sex only. That it rages with dcathlv
virulence among young women, especially among
young ladies in the higher circles of society, is

a, matter of notoriety. Dr. Fowler writes.

"Tlnit women, young and apparently modest,
are dying by thousands of consum])tion. of fe-
male complaints, of nervous or sjiinal eom-
])laints, of general debility, and of other osten-
sible complaints innumerable, and some of in-
sanity, caused solely by this practice. In con-
firmation of this, Mrs. Gore, in her " Lectures

marks, — ,,Some years since, my mind was
awakened to examine this subject by the perusal
of a medical work that described the bad effects
of this vice (masturbation) when practised by
females. This was the first intimation I had
that the vice existed among our sex; since that
time I have had much evidence that it \s fear-
fully comvion among them. Were this the
particular vice of the low and vulgar, there
might be more excuse for the apathy and false
delicacy that pervades the community resjDecting
it; iutit invades all ranks — professed Christians
ai"e among its victims. Our boarding and day
schools are sources of intolerable mischief."
Mrs. Gore is one of those ladies who, throwing
aside conventionality, have studied anatomy and
medicine; she passed one of the colleges in the
United States, and now enjoys an extensive prac-
tice, as well as much reputation for skill, in
Boston, Mass. On this subject her testimony is
of value, and we do not scruple to make use of it.
The effect of self-pollution in the male is similar
in the female; tlie results common to both are
impotency in the one, and sterility or barrenness
in the other. We observe amongst them much
tendency to historical complaints. Consumption

numbers amongst its victims many young and
fair, who have first brou-ght on its seed by self-
abuse. The glairy discharge, so common and
so weakening, and which is generally termed
the "Whiies,'' is another frequent result of this
error. AVe do not mean to assert that in every
instance this discharge is thus caused. I have
known many instances where it has been caused
by excessive intercourse with the husband; but
when it occurs amongs unmarried Avomen of a
certain age, self pollution, though not the in-
variable cause, is one of the most prominent
anxl predisposing. But enough on this very
painful subject— we probe the wound deeply
that Ave may the sooner heal it. Should this fall
into the hands of one who has sinned, let her re-
member that science and skill may do much to
restore to health and happiness — let her repent,
and pray that "she sin no more."

Many individuals scarcely turned forty years

of their inclination for snch duties gradually
becomes much diminished, and that is a symp-
tom which is at all times indicative of approach-
ing impotence; for the inclination gradually aiul
entirely ceasing, the power speedily follows, or
rather botli are lost together. In others, about
the same time of life, the physical power ceases
first, and the inclination continuing, often for
many years after, they are oliged to gratify
themselves in amusements which are the more
'pantnwime of anioj'ouf; indulgences! Such in-
dividuals, being otherwise in tolerable health,
are recoverable.

Many who have unwarily acquired the habit
of self-pollution have been convinced, by read-
ing this treatise, of its iniquity and injurious
consequences to health, and have determined to
give it up, thinking that by so doing they may
recover their pristine health and vigor. In this,
hoAvevcr, tliey are deceived. A new and un-
natural association having been established be-
tween the organs of generation and the mind,
the bad consequences of the practice do not
cease when the habit is left ofp. Involuntary
discharges of semen take place during sleep,
occurring as frequently as two or three times

symjitoms already described are aggravated, and
the mind sinks into a state of the deepest de-

should immediately apply for the necessary
medicine, and the practice being discontinued
(certainly a main point in the case) they may
confidently anticipate the speedy renovation of
their constitution. I therefoi-e recommend an
early application for advice and assistance,
which in every case will be given with that kind
consideration and undeviated attention that will
give confidence to the timid, and restore vigor
to the debilitated.

NESS, IMPOTENCE, STERILITY, AND
NERVOUS EXHAUSTION.

The secretory glands of the human body form
an apparatus, tlie action of whicli is unvarying
and constant. Tlie liver is perpetually employ-
ed in the formation of hile; the kidneys, in the
separation of urine from the blood. In fact, all
the secretions are derivable from the living and
vitalizing fluid. The gall-bladder is provided
as the temporary receptacle for the bilious
soapy fluid secreted by the liver; and as the wants
of the system require, it is poured into the first
intestine to assist in the separation of the
nutritive portion of the partially digested ali-
ment. Precisely analogous is the action of the
testicles, pouring their appropriate secretion
-into the receptacles described in the anatomical
section of this work, and denominated the "vesi-
culce seminales, or seed-Uadders,'' not to be ab-
sorbed again into the system, but rather to be
excreted as indispensable to the reproductive act.

these vessels becomes a pleasurable impulse to the

necessary multiplication of the species; and if
sexual desire were susceptible of gratification
only as the result of instinct; if depraved man,
instead of lashing his genital organs to exertion
by filthy conversation, lewd and impure imagina-
tions, and the various causes which are entirely
absent among the brute creation ; if, like them, he
were content to follow the dictates of his unerring
organization, diseases from excess would be un-
knoAvn , equally among us as with them ; and their
proverbial and almost certain fecundity be but
the transcript of our own. As the seminal vessels
(like the gall-bladder) Avill not allow of extra-
ordinary distention the ihinner portions of tlie
semen become parfialJy absorbed; and though
thereby the bulk of tliat secretion be lessened,
yet the residuum becomingmore acrid and stimu-
lating, the impulse to excretion is thus rendered
unconquerable; and so nature (in the absence of
the act to which the stimulating impulse tends)
occasionally relieves herself of the superabundant
secretion. Of tliis act, men are mostly un-
conscious; if, however, it arrest attention, its
frequency and its consequences are the circum-
stances that rouse the proper and natural fears
of tlie sufferer.

" The causes of these nightly or 'wet dreams,^ as
they are called, are mwierous. In the first place,
the testicles must have acquired, through the
practice of Onanism, (for involuntary emissions
rarely assume the formidable character here de-
picted, except induced by masturbation), a
morbid sensitiveness, that, on the slightest local
or neighboring irritation, they put in action their
secretive powers. Iti fact, the infirmity might
not inaptly he termed a consuvijjfioii of those
glands. Consequently, the causes may be, at this
period, piles or hemorrhoids, constipation, in-
digestion, irritability of the bladder, or kidneys,
&c., &c. ; for they all, more or less are present,
and, perhaps, severally aggravated by stimuli,
of one kind or other, taken during the day or
pre\aously to rest. Another occasion may be the
loss of tone of the absorbents, and also loss of
the sensibility of the passages through which the
discharge escapes; thereby acting as somnolent
sentinels only to the brain, Avhereby even the
little control the will might possess is lost! So
by this we perceive that this infirmity is not
merely local debility of the generative apparatus,
but that many other functions of life particij)ate
in it. The constant drain from the testicles im-
poverishes the whole system, and the same phe-

nomena ensue as when Onanism is practised to
the same extent. The semen of a person torment-
ed with this infirmity is thin, watery, sickly
odored and rarely prolific. Although I have al-
ready depicted the consequences of unnatural
indulgences in the previous pages, the following
passage, from a more able pen than my own,
exhibits so well the desolating effects alluded to,
that its transcript is too useful to my purpose to
neglect: — ^"The muscles of the youth become
soft; he is idle; his body becomes bent; his gait
is sluggish, and he is scarcely able to support
himself. The digestion becomes enfeebled, the
breath fetid; the intestines inactive; the ex-
crements hardened in the rectum, and producing
additional irritation of the seminal conduits in
its vicinity. The circulation being no longer free,
the youth sighs often, the complexion is livid,
and the skin, on the forehead especially, is
studded with pimples. The corners of the
mouth are lengthened, the nose becomes sharp;
the sunken eyes, deprived of brilliancy, and en-
closed in blue circles, are cast down; no look of
gayety remains — the very aspect is criminal.

for any operation. The imagination gives
birth only to fantasies and fears without
grounds ; the slighest allusion to the dominat-
ing passion produces a motion of the muscles
of the face, the flush of shame, or a state of
despair. The wretched being finishes by shun-
ning the face of men, and dreading the obser-
vation of women. His character is entirely
corrupted, or his mind is totally stupefied.
Involuntary loss of the reproductive liquid
takes place during the night, and also during

Avoulcl not tell most powerfully and detrimen-
tally upon the offspring. The opinions of tlie
learned, in all ages, have not varied widely on
this subject. Lucretius, and a great numl^er
of ancient physiologists, admitted this doctrine.
That great man considered that there wa,s a
mixture of fluids, and that these, united in
the sexual organs of the female, were animated,
developed, and changed into a being resembling
those wlio furnished them. Further, that the
most vi(joro7is of the two determined the sex;
and if this principle be admitted, it is ea-sy to
trace every puny or diseased peculiarity the
father or motlier may transmit. It appears to
be tlie general opiiiion that whichever parent-
furnishes the most elahoraie, the most abundayit
seminal fluid would imjjress the lineaments and
form- upon the offspring; that tlio most vigorous
jjarent wlio would possess most genital power,
would determine the sex and physical cliaracter of
the infant; and conseqi;ently that offspring
would most certainly resemble this ])aront,

both. But this can scarcely bo expected,

Of Semikal Weakness. — The prominent
character of Senmial Weakness is general, not
■partial, debility. The seminal vessels are fitted
to perform certain functions with progressive
regularity, which, if undisturbed by disease,
or unimpaired by vicious perversion of the
natural sexual habit, they Avill continne to exe-
cute through the Avhole range of the years of
active manhood. Sexual abilili/ in man is a.
mysteriously compound poAver, requiring a
perfect association in the action of the secret-
ory organ of the seminal secretion, and the
instrument of its ejaculation and discharge.
Any functional irregularity, or want of corres-
pondency between the action of the testicles
and penis, is therefore an unquestionable state
of disease; for since both are so closely and
intimately dependent on each other, the least
Avant of exactness in their adaptation might
be the cause of Impotence. Whatever be the
mode in which this deviation from the healthy
and natural action of the parts is first induced,
it is not difiicult to trace its inevitable effect
in the production of Seminal DeMlity and the
ultimate destruction of sexual power. Irrita-

tion, however engendered, rapidly propagates
itself along the uretlva; and chronic inflam-
mation of the prostatic and most sensitive
portion of that canal is rapidly established,
and the muscles surrounding the membranous
division of the urinary passage are sympatheti-
cally alfected with irregular spasm. The
irritation extends itself by continuity of sur-
face to the seminal vesicles, and even to the
testicles, producing in the former unnatural
evacuations, and in tlie latter an exaggerated
thin secretion, too rapidly elaborated, and
therefore, for all the purposes of generation,
worthless.

Among individuals so alfected (on attempt-
ing intercourse with the sex) the emissio?i is too
quickly discharged, nocturnal pollutions are
frequent (indeed these are often the immediate
precursors of seminal weakness) or the semen is
expelled during the evacuation of the Madder
and ioioels. With some, there is more or less
complete extinction of venereal desire, llie
erections become few and feeble, incom])letc,
or absolutely impossible. This condition of
the sexual organs has its ajjpropriate general
character, analogoi;s to those which are attribu-

of earlier youth ; the sufferer, now perhaps
too late, sensibly aliv.e to the origin of his
weakness, becomes timid, fearful, careless of
the world around him, his mind absorbed in
the consideration of his malady, until the
continual presence and recurrence of the same
train of painful thought inyolve him in the
worst form of mooiomania, or rather the pre-
mature childishness of old age. All the func-
tions of the body languish and are deranged,
until a complete and general degredation sweeps
with uncontrolled dominion over every poAver
and faculty, both of body and soul. The semi-
nal fluid may dribble away without jjleasicre,
without erections, without the natural ejaculation
and its loss, when occurring in this manner,
gives rise to the same or infinitely greater evils
than those which occur from mere sexual excess,
or what is worse, from self pollution.

The term Impotence is applied as relative to
that inal)ility or incapacity to the performance
of the sexual act, wliich may arise from a va-
riety of causes, but from none so frequently as
the excesses of Sensualism, more especially the
secret, vicioiis, and solitary indulgences of self-
pollution. It is important, in a practical jDoint
of view, that we do not confound this condition

of the generative system with Stekiuty, inas-
much as a male who is sterile, or a barren
female, may possess a perfect aptitude for coi-
tion, though for all the purposes of procreation
absolutely incapable. In Impotence there is a
temporary or permanent destruction of those
powers which are absolutely essential for gen-
erative purposes. Sterility may therefore be
defined as inability to propagate the species,
though not to affect the sexual congress; while
Impotejicy in either sex, whether natural or ac-
quired, whether as the result of disease or mal-
formation, entirely precludes its pierformance.
Impotence, resulting from physical imperfec-
tion of the sexual organs, is mostly incurable;
but when originating in such disorders of the
urinary or genital apparatus as are traceable to
irritation or inflammation of those structures,
or to conditions however produced, tlience re-
sulting, such as thickening of the bladder, en-
largement of the prostate glands or testicles,
wasting of the penis, especially long-continued
gleets and strictures, our first efforts are natu-
rally directed to the removal of those proximate
causes of Impotence; and if the habit bo siill

circumstances, Nature do not readily reassume
lier wonted functions, if there be remaining de-
bility, it is necessary to invigorate the frame by
the employment, not merely of those diffusable
stimuli which act generally upon the whole sys-
tem, but by the administration of remedies
which are known to act immediately upon the
generative organs. If there be present excessive
irritability, it is necessary to employ such reme-
dies as tend to diminish irritation in the mor-
bidly sensitive organs.

The causes of Impotence in man arise from
two soiirces — from vicious malformation of the
genitals, or from want of power; but among
women. Impotence can only depend on malfor-
mation, either natural or acquired. These
causes are more commonly observed in man
than in the other sex, and this is easily ac-
counted for by the greater part the male has to
perform in the nuptial congress. This is evi-
dent from the phenomena which gave the virile
men\ber the form and disposition proper for
erection, the introduction of the organ, and the
ejaculation of the semen, which are effected by
a violent and complicated action, requiring a
concurrence of many indispensable conditions,

the hody participating at this moment in a
strange convulsion, as though nature at the in-
stant forgot every other function. It will l)e
.obvious that the treatment must admit of wide
modification, as Impotence may be ahsolute or
relative, constitutional or local, direct or indi-
rect, transient or ajyparently jyermanent. Many
defects of conformation are sufficient, more or
less completely, to interfere with the sexual act;
among men, preternatural length, closure, or
adhesion of the foreskin, constituting^;//?//»o.«i'.s'

Among females, adhesion of the sides of the va-
gina is not so common as an imperforate state
of the hymen, which occassionally closes so com-
pletely the entrance to the internal organs, that
the menstrual secretion has been known to ac.
cumulate behind that membrane, and for wan)
of the natural outlet, the cavity of the Avomb
has naturally assumed a distention closely simu-
lating that of pregnancy. Some, from constitu-

solely in relation to posterity ; it is doubtful
Avhether under such circumstances her sense of
duty ^vould atone for the absence of inclination.
Excessive venery, and the profuse discharges of
flvor albus, or the whites, are susceptible of
completely destroying all jiowcr of excitement
in women; hence prosHhifes, from over-stiimi-
latmi of the generative organs, seldom conceive.
Tra?isieni impotence is often the result of mere
apprehension. Too eager desires, too ardent
imagination, the ecstatic effect produced by the
sight of a beloved object, extreme nervous sus-
ceptibility, are often sufficient to produce tem-
porary impotence.

It i« not unusual to meet with instances of
married people becoming quite indifferent to
each other's embraces. A patient of mine con-
fessed to me his inability to complete the sexual
act with his wife, unless, by an effort of the
fancy, imagination conjured up the form of
some more voluptuous female. Physical defect
onay constitute the cause of impotence, but more
frequently there is neither organic defect nor
local disease ; the affection is a mere nervous
suspension of poAver, which is soon removed
under proper management. Even this has its

wise ordination. Any individual, however ner-
vons in his physical capacity, if he anticipate
with too intense eagerness intercourse Avith a
beloved object, will seldom perform tJie act
well. Even amcmg the most ardent and pow-
erful, it occurs, as many liave confessed, that
after Avaiting time after time for opportunity,
when that has arrived, they have not had the
power to take advantage of it ; a nervous anx-
iety, a tremulous delight absolutely indefinable,
has completely throAvn prostrate all power, and
the object of passion has been saved from per-
dition by its paralyzing all the fire and ardency
of animal desire. If the imagination Avander
from the tasV, temporary Im/iwfence is the re-
sult ; and many Avriters are firmly of opinion
that impregnation is often impeded from the
presence of ideas Avliich interfere with the due
performance of the generative act. Sterne has
happily commented on this point in one of his
most popular Avorks, introducing liis maternal
parent as asking at a most viitimeJi/ moment,
whether his "father had not forgotten to wind
irp the clock." His views are strictly physio-
logical. Such is tlie power of the moral over
the physical state of man !

Impotence in the male may arise, then, from
a Avide diversity of conditions. Incuj^acity of
erection, generally referable to self-pollution ;
Imx^otence, arising from a want of poAver of re-
tention in the seminal vessels, induced by a
morliid susceptibility of those vessels, and
biouglit about in like manner by a persistence
in the same vicious practice ; Impotence, from
inability of retention resnlting from repletion
of these vessels, all demand a variety of treat-
ment peculiar to the jrrecisc condition of the
joarts. Impotence from mental influence has
also its appropriate management. Exclusive of
this, the generative infirmity under considera-
tion, though occasionally arising from simple
disease, is ascribable in by far the greater ma-
jority of instances to the excesses of Sensualism,
either with women, or, moi'c commonly still,
from iliat vile excess to Avhich such frecptent al-
lusion has been made in these pages. Long-
protracted chastity or continence is not to be
overlooked as a cause of Impotence: the veiy
reverse 'of the degrading habit of self-pollution,

its very nature the indications of cure. But
that long-continued debauchery, whether Avith
women or by masturbation, is to be assigned as

the most common and prominent of the causes
of Impotence, is a fact admitted hy all syste-
matic Avriters, and amply and painfully con-
firmed by my own experience. Mons. Pincl
observes, — " The Impotence caused by ilie la/lcr
excess reduces youth to the n ullity of old aye, and
is too often incurable.''' Fortunately, tlie re-
cords of a numerous list of cases prove that re-
covery of the powers of manhood is not (under
judicious management) so altogether hopeless,
as might seem to be the fact, trusting only to
the observation of those medical men who have
made these subjects their peculiar and exclusive
studies.

Impotence is often caused by debility of the
genital organs, induced by precocious venereal
enjoyments, or by the unresti-aincd abuse of the
delicate structures in any method that tends to
produce repeated and severe evacuations of the
seminal fluid. If impotence result from self-
pollution, there is a want of erection, and should
ii seminal emission take i»laee, the semen does
not possess its prolilic power, and thus the man
is at once Impotent and Steiui.e. This form
of impotence is truly deplorable, and unfor-
tunately it is the most prevalent variety : never-

without amorous impulse. Next to Self-polhi-

impotence, as well as of sterility among the
male sex. This is a freciuent cause of want of
offspring in young married 2)erso7is, In tlieso

the ejaculatory muscles, is imperfect in quality,

to be consigned to a premature grave, the vic-
tim of that nameless airopliy or wasting decay
wliich hurries thousands- of ijifants annually to
the tomb. In these cases tlic male parent gene-
rally suffers from inliammatiou of the seminal

the facts connected with such a statement, that

be the first, greatest, and most lasting blessing,
and its deprivation or absence the greatest pos-
sible curse, how imperatively necessary is the
obligation to calculate closely the tendency of
vicious indulgences, to avoid the contamination
of depraved habits, and to correct and elude
the consequences of that debility already im-
posed upon the generative organs by sensual
excess ! ImpotejsTCE and Stekility are nsualhj
the results of wilful imprudence. Malformation
is a direct interposition of creative wisdom ; its
occurrence is comparatively rare ; hut failing
poiver is not only exceedingly common, hut gene-
rally constitutes a self-inflicted evil. Diseased
and delicate parents procreate diseased and

And this is an eminently Avise ordination, as
tending to the perpetnity of a healtliy race of
human beings.

If Sensualism have impaired the powers, not
of both parents, but of one onlj-, the punish-
ment of the offence is either Sterility or de-

crowning scourge of sexual ■imperfeciion, and
demands for its removal tl/e most cautious appli-
cation of tlie resources of tlie liealiiig art. Tlie
treatment of the chronic diseases of tlie genc-
I'ative system has been strangely neglected and
signally misunderstood. The eflicacy of well-
directed efforts lias been much mistrusted iu
this matter, and it is remarkable that lioth the
patient and practioner contribute to these im-
pediments : for as the latter has been accus-
tomed to see his remedies speedy in their effects,
ho is himself discouraged if they do not imme-
diately produce the desired benefit. Xor is il
any wonder that the patient becomes incredu-
lous of the promised relief, neither of them
recollecting that the morbid states Inive been
slowly pi-oduccd, and cannot therefore be
speedily changed.

Self-pollution, the frequent cause of sexual
Impotence and Sterility, is generally the habit
of the best years of youthful life ; and its dead-
ening impress often tells with deplorable cer-
tainty, long after the baneful habit has been re-
Jinquishcd. Time must therefore be afforded
for the rectihcation of that artificial state into
which the powers of the system has been Avan-
tonly plunged. It is evidently the absence of
fixed principles, in our pathology of the slow
diseases of the generative system, that has
given such unbridled license to quacTcery. There
has always existed a vagueness of opinion re-
specting their nature, and an unsettled doctrine
as to the most rational methods to be adopted
for their mitigation and cure. The communi-
cation of disordered action is an inevitable re-
sult of indulgence in any mode of Sensualism,
either excessive, or contrary to the order of na-
ture and the constitution of our being; and the
nature of that perverted action may be readily
anticipated. In fact, we see it exemplified in
excessive irritability of the bladder and seminal
vesicles, producing incapability for retention,
disease of the spinal marrow and brain, spasm
of the urethra, and stricture, an effeminate
flaccidity of the penis, testicles, and scrotum.

Can it be expected that these organs sliould be
capable under such circumstances of fulfilling
their appropriate office in the task of procrea-
tion ? Most assuredly not. Where impoteuce is
consequent vpon that lianef ul propeiisity, lohich
cannot le sufficiently stigmatized, its extent of
severity is far greater than when produced hy
excessive indulgence vnth women, because the
vital fluid that could have improved the stamina
of the system has been lost without satisfaction; .
consequently no gratification of the mind has
been had in counterpoise to compensate, and in
some measure to repair the expenditure of power.

The man who, from his anxiety to indulge to
the utmost his libidinous propensities, seeks for
variety among women, may certainly find in
such variety a new stimulus sufficient for the
occasion, and may be able to accomplish more
frequent repetitions of the sexual act than the
sober married man who is faithful to one ; but
we cannot overlook the fact that this is un-
doubtedly accomplished at the expense of a cor-
responding amount of unnatural excited energy,
and the ultimate results of such efforts tell with
fearful and tremendous horrors upon the help-
less and debilitated votary of greedy pleasure.

by the sexual organs, Avhen fnlly charged with
the seminal fluid and impatient for relief ; to
such a man, tha stimulus of variety is unsought,
contemned, forbidden, as contrary not merely
to all laws, human and divine, but as directly
opposed to his well-being, to the maintenance
of his animal organization in health, strength,
and usefulness. Here, then, the natural laws
of his physical constitution harmonize most ad-
mirably with the liiglier sanctions of morality.
The actual amount of enjoyment realized by the
temperate is, in the long run, far greater; power
is maintained until old age, and a vigorous off-
spring is engendered ; Avhile the hasty, violent,

that worst form of helplessness — insatiable de-

animal organization, that when motion is in-

those parts which are most susceptible, and
these, among Sensualists, are the parts of gene-

cessive venery in these, whom warm passion has
united in its indissoluble tie, amount only to
the defeat of their wishes. Celsus remarked
upon this subject more than eighteen centuries
ago: " Rarus concuhitus cor2ms exbitaf, fre-
qucns solvit f Avhich may be freely translated,
" The bodily powers are excited by occasional
coition, by frequent repetition they become re-
laxed," and consequently unprolific ; or as a
poet has expressed the same sentiment — ■

" While temperate pleasure spurs the lazy blood,
Excess unstrings the nerves, iind dries the flood."

and so truly is it witlrin the experience of many,
that when the first warm anxiety for offspring,
and its corresponding efforts, have passed away
and subsided, the blessing is granted to less
passionate, exciting, and frequent embraces.

NERVOUS EXHAUSTIOis-.



The ancient pliysioians uere right in their
general rule : the longer parties abstain, tlie
more quickly they generate. Almost all pliy-
siologists noAV agree that the retention of semen
for some few days, or tem^Jorary abstinence from
coition, is necessary to generation. During mij
practice, many persons Jf ave consiMed me on ac-
count of want of family, winch entirely arose
from this cause. Such cases require great deli-
cacy in their investigation, liut it is not difficult
to learn their nature when science, caution and
sympathy ai'C duly exerted. Conjttgal, domestic
and social incom^eniences mustahvays be aroid-
ed ; and it is scarcely to be observed, because
of its obvious truth, that excessive sexual cnjoy-
m.e7it relaxes both pa7'ties, and may, even in the
married state, defeat its own and, lie unfruitful,
from too frequent repetition ; and bring on that
atony, Aveakness, and debility of the generative
organs, which may end in sterility in tlic female
and impotence in the male.

If these things be so (and who will dare to
contravene their truth, founded as it is on tlie
ordinary cvery-day observation of mankind ?)
it follows that there are, and ma}' be, varieties
of SEMINAL WEAKNESS, originating most com-
monly in NOCTLiHXAL KMissTONS, and tlicsc, dc-

pendent in many instances (but not invariably
so) on the unnatural practice of self-pollu-
tion; to wliieJi sucli ample reference has been
made in the foregoing pages. That these eviis-
sions lead to the most deplorable consequences,
independently of the injury doiie to the genera-
*tiYe function, is indisputable. The most studi-
ous people, and tliose of splenetic cast, are sub-
ject to this infirmity, and the discharge of semen
is commonly so considerable, that tliey fall into
a slow wasting consumption. A Roman phy-
sician (whose opinion is supported by John of
Acarius, author of a work composed for the
Emperor) observes, '• //' nocturnal emissions
co/ifinne any time, the necessary consequences
arc consumption and death; for the most bal-
samic part of the human and aninuil spirit is
dissipated ; the whole body falls away, and par-
ticularly the back ; the patients become feeble,
dry, and pale ; they languisli in sIoav melan-
choly agony." Let this antiquated, yet terrifi-
cally correct portraiture, deter tlie thoughtless
from practices which lead to such a state ; and
those in Avhom it is commencing, let not in-
cipient evil be deemed unworthy of their most
serious consideration.



LECTURE V.



THE MORAL AXD PHYSICAL EFFECTS OF SELF-
ABUSE — SPERMATOBRHCEA — IMPOTESTCE.

All the faculties are weakened by indulgence
in this vice. The sense of hearing loses its
acutencss, and uiuch annoyance is caused by
noiscs and singing in the ears ; sometimes even
deafness results. The eyes lose their brilliancy,
end appear dull ; tlie pupils are always more or
less dilated. According to Eichter — one of the
most eminent of sui-gical authorities — " JSfo
general ivealcening causes ojperate tqjon the ei/es and
occasion total hlindness so powerfully and so often
as 2J>'emature and excessive indulgences in venereal
pleasures.^' Another of the evils resulting from
self-pollution is a failure in the power of the
mind, especially tlie memory. In short, it may
be stated Avith the utmost conlidence that tiiei-e
is not an intellectual faculty with wiiich tlie
beneficent Creator has blessed us that is not
liable to bo imjDaired by these causes. It is a
curious fact that the habit of self-pollution is
invariably foUoAved by a diminution in the size of
the penis. Tlie organ shrinks to one-half its
former outline, or, in those Avho have practised

it in youth, does not attain to full growth. The
power of perfect erection is altogetlier destroy-
ed ; when coition is attempted, the requisite
solidity is not maintained, or if an entrance in-
to the A-agina be partially etfected, it is followed
by a premature emission. Let not the victim
of secret vice flatter himself his unmanly act
escapes detection. Dr. Armstrong observes—
" I think I should know a person in the streets
who has addicted himself to this vice, by merely
walking behind him, from his peculiar gait."

From the commencement of the unfortunate
habit of self-pollution, which is invariably the
cause of seminal weakness, there is frequently
a loss of desire for sexual intercourse ; or Avhere
the desire is felt, a repetition of the unmanly
habit is preferred to coition in a natural way.
This, when persisted in, causes the face to be-
come pale, bloated, and cadaverous, the body
feeble and emaciated, and an impeded circula-
tion in the extremities. Then occur trembling
hands, dim eyes, confused ringing in the ear,
sometimes deafness, accompanied Avith frequent
and violent headache. A nervous dread and
loss of energy are very common, and Ave have
frequently heard patients confess that they have
walked their rooms for hours together at night.

fcai-iiig to go to bod. This is often o:q;crieiice(I
when tlio ]iocturn;il seminal emissions are nu-
merous. We may liere observe that tlte prac-
tice of Onanism may sometimes be indul^'-ed in
without apparent ill effects for a time. Some
are affected in a month or two, some may escape
for years ; but not any entirely escape, for it is
impossible to violate any law of Xature and of
ISTature's God without evil consequences result-
ing. The practice of Onanism is a moral and
physical crime, consequently the punisliment is
twofold. Thus, Avhile the bodily vigor is lost,
and the senses lose their keenness, the inind
also becomes affected, the memory fails, the
judgment becomes defecti^-e, and the patient
becomes unable to any exertion, bodily or men-
tal. Such is the history of many cases of sui-
cide of Avhich we read in the newspapers ; cases
mysterious, at first sight causeless, but under-
stood by the educated physician, regarding them
by the clear light of science. Tissot, the cele-
brated physician and early writer on this sub-
ject, states the result of this jn-actice to be.
First : — Total derangement of the stomach,
shown in loss or irregularity of appetite and
indigestion. In some cases the appetite bo-
comes almost voracious ; Nature tiius endeav-

oiu-ing to xeinm- the loss inflicted upon her.
Second :— AYeakness of the respiratory organs ;
whence frecpiently result dry coughs, almost al-
most always colds, weakness of the voice, and
sense of sufiocation on slight exertion. Third :
—General relaxation of the nervous system,
lassitude by day, painful dreams by night ; the
sleep is unrefreshing. Fourth :— Great debility
of the organs of generation ; almost all com-
plaining of only imperfect erections ; desire no
longer exists, and impotence results. Noctur-
nal emissions are a terrible scourge to these suf-
ferers, and often overwhelm those even whose
organs are absolutely senseless when awake.
AVhcn these patients have had nocturnal pollu-
tions, they find themselves the next day in a
state of depression, of discouragement, debility,
ennui, and lassitude, Avith pains in the loins,
head, and eyes. Fifth :— Eruptions frequently
appear on the face and forehead ; the features
become changed from the rosy hue of health to
a dull, heavy, and sallow complexion.

We will conclude this part of the subject Avith
a few Avords respecting spermatorrhoea and im-
potence. Tliis term spermatorrhcea is derived
from two Greek Avords, signifying a flowing of
seed, and is applied to all cases in Avhioh an



84



emission of tlie seed takes place, excepting from
coition ; in other Avords, spermatorrlia'a may be
termed an involnntary loss of the semen. Tlie
nsual causes of this disease are self-pollution,
hut it may also he the result of immoderate in-
dulgence in coition, of ill-cured gleet, and fre-
quently of disease of the prostrate gland. Con-
stipation of the bowels, and the irritation of
the rectum caused by piles, may also predispose.
But after all, the influence of these causes is
insignificant compared Avith that of self-abuse.
The symptoms of spermatorrhoea may be divided
into local and constitutional. The local sym])-
toms are generally emissions of seed at night ;
and we call the particular attention of our
readers to this rule. Nocticrnal emissions are
decided signs of dehility and symptoms of ap-
proacliing impotence. Let it be remembered
that every drop that escapes is the habitation of
living beings, a particle of the living seed, and
that one drop, under favorable circumstances,
is suflficient to give life to a future being. "With
respect to diurnal emissions — which occur at
stool, Avhilst making water, or which are evident
in a continual moisture and humidity of rhe
organs — they are of a com]ilioated character,
and in many instairces are undiscovered and

85



unsuspected b}'' tlie patient until the disorder
lias assumed a most formidable character ; for
he is quite unconscious of any seminal loss.
The nocturnal emissions sometimes leave him
entirely, the drain by day being so excessive;
but at last some formidable symptoms force him
to seek relief at the eleventh hour. During
the progress of spermatorrhea many patients
suffer from a hard dry cough, a difficulty of
breathing, pains in the chest, and hence are
treated for consumption ; for the constitutional
symptoms of spermatorrhoea are innumerable,
and when the cause of disease is unknown and
unsuspected, the general practitioner will natu-
rally attack the symptoms. The appetite, at
first, will frequently increase and become vora-
cious — it is the effort nature makes to support
the failing strength. All the senses are more
or less affected — the eye loses its brillianc}^,
there is always more or less dilatation of the
pupil, and the very look of the ])atient reveals
his secret to the glance of experience. The
penis and testicles become small and relaxed ;
and a high surgical authority observes, the in-
firmity may not inaptly be termed a consump-
tion of these glands. And we cannot be as-
tonished at the frightful effects caused by un-



86



NERVOUS EXHAUSTION.



natural emissions of seed, when we recollect
that physicians of all ages are agreed that the
loss of one ounce of semen by self-abuse, noc-
turnal emissions, or at stool, injures the system
and weakens it more than the abstraction of
twelve ounces of blood. In the early stages of
seminal weakness, different persons are various-
ly affected ; some are incapable of procuring a
discharge of semen into the cavity of the female
genitals in a natural way, though they may
effect temporary erection ; while others cannot
perform the act of copulation, from the emission
taking place too quickly, and before the proper
firmness of the male organ has enabled it to
effect the requisite penetration. To recapitu-
late briefly the results of our expe.iience: — Im-
potence, the effect of long-continued sperma-
torrhcea, is the inability to perform the venereal
act. Those cases are most difficult to cure
which have been caused by self-pollution ; but
science, combined with skill and experience,
Avill almost effect miracles, and our treatment
of these cases has been moct successful. Impo-
tence is also caused by too free indulgence in
sexual pleasures ; these cases can be cured with
comparative ease by rest and tonic medicines.
Impotence is sometimes the result of moral



NERVOUS EXHAUSTIOK.



87



causes — nervousness, too much respect, &c.;
the treatment is obvious. Impotence, then, is
chiefly caused by debility of the genital organs;
there is a Avant of erection, and if a seminal
emission takes place, the semen docs not possess
its prolific power, and the man is at once impo-
tent and sterile. Sterility, or barrenness, is
sometimes the vice of female organization, and
is produced by various causes ; amongst others
which entail a loss of vital and productive
energy, excessive indulgence is one of the most
prominent. Excessive venery is a frequent
cause of want of offspring in young married
people. In these cases the seed does liot ac-
qwive suflicient vitality to stimulate the ovum
in the womb ; and even if a child should come
to life, it partakes of the debility of the parent,
and is soon hurried to a premature grave, the
victim of that nameless atrophy or wasting
away which kills its thousands of infants annu-
ally. Impotence and sterility are usually the
result of wilful imprudence. Malformation is
very rare ; but failing power is not only exceed-
ingly common, but generally constitutes a self-
inflicted evil. The author is frequently con-
sulted by those contemplating marriage, and
whenever bad habits have existed, or weakness

IS experienced, the precaution is most Avise, and
may prevent much future unhappiness. Like-
vise, as respects the married man, it often oc-
curs that a few minutes' confidential conversa-
tion with one who has made these subjects a
special study is attended lo^y the hapjiiest re-
sults. There are resources in the science of
medicine, and few, very fcAv, need despair of
restoration to the power of manhood. But we
will refrain from further details ; our object is
friendly suggestion, not importunate dictation.
We will conclude this chapter with a few words
of the celebrated Lallemand: — " Many diseases,
when left to themselves, Avork their oavu cure,
providing only they be not exasperated by the
imprudence of the patient. This is not the
case Avith spermatorrha?a, chiefly, perhaps, be-
cause the effects produced by the disease itself
are favorable to the increase of involuntary dis-
charges. The natural tendency of this disease
to become aggravated, as the resuU of its own
effects, frequently leads to a fatal termination.
The patients generally expire in one of the at-
tacks of syncope that folloAV congestion of the
brain. In this Avay such of the insane Avho have
fallen into a state of dementia usually cx])ire.
Many die from diseases (as consumption, &c.)

aggravated and inflamed by unsuspected sper-
matorrlioea ; the symptoms are treated by the
physician, but the great cause, spermatorrha3al
remains unsuspected."

MODERN TREATMENT OF SPERMATORRHCEA, SE-
MINAL WEAKNESS AND NERVOUS DEBILITY.

Like many other intractable diseases, sperma-
torrhoea has been the "opprobrium medicorum"
of the rcguhir practitioner. From its tedious-
ness, the medical man is wearied of it ; and like
an obstinate gleet, after trying all possible
remedies, has given it up in despair. Nor is
this altogether to be wondered at, when we
consider the extreme difficulty of the diagnosis,
excepting by microscopic observations ; and to
xise the microscope in these cases with effect re-
quires skill, care, experience, and a thorough
knoAvledge of the disease. Spermaton-hoea is a
drainage, a waste, a dribbling away of the semi-
nal fluid. As already explained, it may exist
unknown, and, consecpiently, unattended to
until great mischief has been inflicted on the
constitution and vital powers. Now, what are
the indications of treatment ? Naturally, to
. give tone to the vessels tluu neglect their office;
to prevent the too profuse secretion of tho



90



NERVOUS EXHAUSTION.



impovorislied fluid ; to esablish a healthy reli-
ance between the two ; to remove the provoking
causes that brought about the first estrange-
ment ; to repair the mischief done to the gene-
ral health ; to cultivate the mind into a higher
notion of its importance, and thereby withhold
the irritating consequences of disordered im-
agination. The treatment, then, of spermator-
rhea and its accompanying afl'ections, mental
and physical, may be divided into— First:—
Local and Constitutional; Second:— J/oraZ and
Dietetic. The first step on which we must in-
sist is the relinquishing of those practices which
have occasioned the disease. This is essential ;
the most careful and the most scientific treat-
ment must otherwise increase the mischief,
and, by giving greater temporary strength, en-
uhle the patient to inflict on himself more per-
manent evils. A due attention to air, exercise,
sleep, and regimen is ni all cases proper, and
entirely within the control of the patient. A
local remedy of great value is cold water ; the
sponge-bath or shower-bath should be used in
the morning, a small quantity of bay salt being
d issolved in tlic water. Coarse towcllins: and
flesh-brushes should be used after the bath ; a
suspensory bandage should be used ; the diet

91



should be generous, but not stimulating, animal
food in moderation, and he should cat a little
and often, rather than take too full a meal.
Exercise must not be neglected, moderate at
first, and gradually augmented. Stimulating
drinks are improper, spirits in all cases hurtful;
a glass or two of Avine may be taken if demand-
ed by preyious habit. In this case a pale dry
sherry Avill be best. With respect to medicines,
a sketch only of the treatment can be offered.
Cases vary so Avidely, that the curative means
must be varied accordingly. The class of drugs
which allay excitement and irritability are first
likely to be required, for the stomach is so
weakened and capracious that the disease is
frequently mistaken for indigestion. Mild and
Cordial laxatives, alterative drugs, Avitli neutral
salts, febrifuges, and sedatives, will soon quiet
the system, and enable it to tolerate tonic or
restorative medicines , which if commenced with
are decidedly injurious. But what is the mean-
ing of tonic ? for no Avord is so much misap-
plied. One man means quinine, another iron,
a third the mineral acids, wliilst a fourth means
stimulants, and so on through the whole Phar-
macopoeia. Now, we mean, not any one, but
the whole class of medicines combined, clianged,



92



NEEVOUS EXHAUSTION.



increased, or diminished to suit the particular
case ; in this consists the real art of scientific
prescribing. One man gradually gathers
strength from quinine, which would not suit
another, whose deteriorated blood-globules will
become red and healthy under the exhibition of
iron, in some of its numerous preparations.
The peculiarity of our treatment consists not
only in the selection of hitherto undiscovered
remedies, but in the practical adaptation of
those Ave already possess. And the above are
but a few of the remedies we emjjloy in gene-
rative diseases or debility. Amongst the most
certain and most valuable for the total cure of
spermatorrhoea — Avhich control that disease
comj^letely, even when caused by long continued
habits of self-abuse — are medicines whose very
names are unknown to the general practitioner.
Under the tropical suii of India, in Thibet,
and the mountainous ranges of Korth-eastern
Hindustan, in tlie forests of Ceylon, are found
plants and herbs grown from the virgin soil,
rich in balsamic virtues, aromatic and cordial.
India, the land of ancient civilization, the
original home of medicine, still retains secrets
which baffle the wisdom of learned physicians.
Who lias not read and wondered at the marvel-

Ions stories of the power and influence exerted
by the " Old Man of the Moimtiiins ?" The
means by which he exerted his influence, by
which he retained the power of life and death
over his followers, by which he comjielled them
to the most desperate enterprises, were com-
prised simply in his knowledge of the herbs,
flowers, and grasses under his feet. Have these
wondrous gifts of Nature now lost their virtue?
I boldly answer, No ! I am in possession of
remedies marvellous in their influence, most
effective in their result, by Avhicli I control the
worst cases of disease and debility, and whicli.
account in a measure for the extraordinary suc-
cess I have met with in special practice. So
when Debility has weakened the mental facul-
ties ; when a long course of dissipation and
solitary habits has destroyed enterprise, energy,
and courage ; when a man feels that he is a
wreck in body and in mind, and dares not even
own it to himself — surely in such cases these
remedies are called for. And no man can treat
successfully the diseases described in these
pages whose medicines are limited to those con-
tained in the American Pharmacopoeia. It is
a question often asked — Is sexual intercourse
indispensable to health ? The reply may be

NERVOUS EXl^AL■s'^^u^■.



taken that at least Nature destined the act of
generation for procreative purposes, and that
not only should it contribute to the delight of
numkind, hut also to their health. Ilence
copulation is permissible and necessar\-, ex-
treme chastity frequently injurious ; and we
often find it advisable to recommend marriasre.
It should also be remembered that copulation
should never be an eSort. This is a golden
rule, and where great languor, droAvsiness, de-
pression, and a feeling of jdiysical exhaustion
follow the act, the time chosen has been inapt,
or the limits have been exceeded. We will con-
clude this j)art of the subject Avith a few words
respecting treatment. Having enjoyed for
many years the friendship of the late celebrated
Lallemand during our residence in Paris, our
practice in cases of spermatorrhoea has neces-
sarily been most extensive. The peculiarit_y of
our treatment is to act directhj on the seminal
vessels, to strengthen without exciting, and so
restore health by removing the cause of disease.
It would be easy to recommend various reme-
dies ; but medicine in the hands of the timid,
the irresolute, or the ignorant, is more likely
to i^roducc evil than advantage. In all cases
let the best advice be sought from one who has



NERVOUS EXHAUSTION.



95



■}))ade these diseases a sjjecial study. Some may
l)e prevented from applying for assistance from
dread of accidental exposure ; it may, there-
fore, be proper to remark, that it is our rule to
destroy all correspondence at the termination
of each case ; or, if preferred, to return it to
the wiiters. Inviolable secrecy and certain re-
lief are the boons we offer to suffering humanity.
Unfortunately, practitioners in this country
have long been averse to selecting this branch
of medical art as a study ; maiiy distinguished
men have risen to fame and atffnence by devo-
ting their talents to midwifery, operative sur-
gery of the eye and ear, &c. The author of
this treatise is content to brave the sneers of the
ignorant and envy of the malicious, when he
reflects on the gratitude of those whom he has
rescued from an untimely grave ; he knows that
in selecti]ig this peculiar department of medi-
cine his usefulness has been increased, and that
he deserves Avell of his fellow-men.

ON CERTAIN URETHRAL DISCHARGES.

"We shall not here consider the gonorrhceal
discharge, as that is treated on in another joart
of the work. There are, however, other dis-
charges, and of a soi-ious nature, which often



96



NERVOUS EXHAUSTION.



call for skilful and attentive treatment. The
first of these is termed gleet, Avhich is the con-
sequence of an ill-cured or neglected gonorrhoea
or clap. There is another discharge, a dis-
charge of semen, without sensation, which is
the result of a debilitated frame, and is fre-
quently induced by long-continued self-iDollu-
tion, or long residence in hot or cold climates.
The penis is invariably damp and clamm}- ;
there is a slight mucous discharge rather thicker
than ordinary clap, which sticks in patches on
the linen, and between the nut and foreskin of
the penis. Under the microscope this dis-
charge is found to consist of spermatozoa, fre-
quently in a mutilated state, and free from
vitality. The affection is characterized by the
emission of semen upon the very first attempt
at sexual intercourse, a7id often lefore a regular
erectioji can tahe place; sitting in a warm room,
horse exercise, and many trivial causes will
produce it. The emission causes little or no
sensation, excepting sometimes a slight spasm.
These discharges are not contagious, but sexual
intercourse should be studiously avoided on
account of the great injury that may result to
the patient. Such discharges are generally
connected with deficiency of generative power.



NERVOUS EXHAUSTION". 97

In one instance under our notice, impotence
was almost complete ; in another (a married
professional man), the powers had greatly de-
clined. These patients were in the prime of
life ; both had, however, led irregular lives.
The irritation in cases of this nature will gene-
rally be found to exist in the prostate gland,
which is often enlarged ; hence a frequent de-
sire to urinate, and a feeling as if the bladder
were never completely emptied, and as though
a few drops of urine were retained in the pos-
terior part of the urethra. This form of dis-
charge is generally confounded with a common
contagious clap, and treated vigorously mth
copaiva, cubebs, and injections. A cure by
these means is utterly impossible ; the disease
IS increased, as the general health suffers from
the remedies. It is, however, quite true that
these patients have previously sulfered from
gonorrhffia, in some instances more than once.
But m order to cure, we must purify the blood
and strengthen the parts. The subject, alto-
gether, IS well worthy the careful attention of
the profession, for these cases are decidedly on
the increase.



LECTURE VI.



VENEREAL DISEASE — HISTORY.

Had the disease, since known by the name of
Venereal, been a familiar one, possessing no
features different from those already recognized
as characterizing affections of the genital or-
gans, and yielding to an already ascertained
treatment, we natnrally should expect that tlie
authors who might notice it Avould never have
thought of designing it as new and unknown ;
neither w^ould they have expressed terror at
encountering it, nor expressed their entire
ignorance as to the means of cure. Sucli.
however, we find to be the fact, from universal
testimony of the writers of the age. The ap-
pearance, indeed, of this new form of disease
was an event so important that mention of it
was made, not only by physicians, but the his-
torians living at the period also record the cir-
cumstance. ^ We will cite the authority of
Gonzalo Hernandez de Oveido, and refer our
readers to his curious volume, in black letter,
in the library of the British Museum. The
date is 1526, ''Sumario dc la Natural Hystorui

de las Indias and Oveido distinctly states tlio
American origin of venereal, and the inability
of the physicians to cure it. Another historian
of the period, Lopez de Clomera, writes, "Be-
cause it was a new disease no one knew what to
do." Other contemporary writers, Paul Jovius
Guicciardiui, &c., express themselves to the
same effect. Most of the early writers attribute
the disease to God's anger ; some to conjunction
of the planets ; others, of more matter-of-fact
views, were disposed to ascribe its origin to
another kind of conjunction, of not so celestial
a nature ; for there are authors of this date
who distinctly notice the primary sores or
chancres, and trace them to their real origin —
contagion by impure intercourse ; they mention
strong salivation by mercury as a cure. Joseph
Greenbank, who describes his OAvn case, in a
work Avritten with much purity of Latinity for
the age, attributes the cause to planetary in-
fluence, lie Avished to keep it secret from his
friends, but they found him out "from the
change in his complexion and no sooner was
it known (and the fact shows in Avhat terror the
disease was held), than " his dearest friends
and relations fled his presence, as they would
an enemy with a drawn sword." The notion

prevailed that it could be caught by merely
breathing the same air with the infected pei--
son ; hence the lower orders Avere driven into
the woods and fields, and left to perish wiili-
out solace or assistance. It formed one of tlie
charges against Cardinal Wolsey, that " whe-n
laboring under venereal he had breathed upon
the king in whispering to him."' Hence, being
looked upon as a contagious disease to whicli
any one was liable, the physicians of the age did
not scruple to publish the cases of princes—
and even churchmen— who had the disease ; and
most of the medical works on the subject are
dedicated either to princes or dignitaries of the
Church. Another opinion was very prevalent
—even now the belief is not yet extinct— that
any one having the disease, by transmitting it
to "another relieved himself; though it was
asserted that, to make the experiment success-
ful, it was necessary that the person to wliom
the infection was to be transferred should never
before have had sexual intercourse. It is
scarcely necessary to add that this atrocious
niul ridiculous belief gave rise to most disgrace
fill outrages. The manner in which the new
disoase ran its devastating course, spreading in
distant countries with a rapidity which, joined

to a complete ignorance of treatment, truly
appalled mankind, must be acknowledged to
constitute a proof of its newness— and univer-
sal testimony leaves no doubt on that score.
That it was first brouglit from the island of St.
Domingo, then called Hispaniola, by the fol-
lowers of Columbus, there is abundant and
satisfactory proof. Few of the Spaniards es-
caped who had connection with the native wo-
man, and the ships of Columbus proceeding to
different ports, the disease spread over Europe
with wonderons rapidity. In 1526, Joseph
Grunback informs us that oji returning from
his travels, he found disease prevailing all over

of tlie frightful prevalence of venereal in Edin-
burgh, issued tlie celebrated proclamation ban-
ishing the infected from the city. The original

dated September 22d, im, and is a very curi-

ordinance "selle be brynt on the cheik with

We may also cite here the more generally
known " Arreste" of the Parliament of Paris,
respecting the venereal, dated March 6th, 1490,
stating that "Because in thys City of Paris
many persons were sick of a certain disease
called the ' Great Pocks,' which had raged in
this kingdom /or //ic last t wo years, as well in
Paris as in other parts of France and as there
was reason to apprehend that it would increase
as the spring advanced, it was advised to pro-
vide accordingly. Thus all strangers having
the disease Avere to leave in twenty-four hours,
and forbidden to enter the city until perfectly
cured. The 2d article ordained, " That every
citizen being diseased conlined himself to his
house." No communication was allowed be-
tween the sick and the inhabitants, under pen-
alty of imprisonment ; and the city gates were
carefully watched. The general prevalence of
the disease can only be accounted for by the

undoubted licentiousness of the age — as we
liave no reason for believing that then, any
more than at present, could it bo propagated
except by actual contact of the venereal matter.
We have enlarged on this subject rather more
than we intended, in ©rdcr to prove the great
difficulty exjierienced from the earliest' period
in eradicating this disease. We have studied
the subject closely — Ave have reviewed the mode
of treatment from the earliest period up to the
present time, and we most unhesitatingly and
emphatically declare that we have reduced the
treatment to a certainty ; that we possess the
means of eradicating the venereal virus from
the constitution without the smallest inconve-
nience to the patient, and that no case leaves
our charge without a thorough and perfect cure
being effected ; that we prevent the possibility
of secondary symptoms, and the numerous skin
diseases to Avhich it gives rise ; and, lastly, our
treatment applies to all who have taken mer-
cury, or have been improperly treated by others.

DISEASES OF INFECTION — GONORRHCEA OR OLAP.

Gonorrhea may be defined to be a contagious
inflammatory disease of the mucous membrane
of the urethra or urinary canal, caused by

impure sexual connection. It sometimes ap-
pears tlie first or second day, but the usual
average is from seven to eight days after inter-
course. On the otlier hand, it is sometimes
delayed for tAvo, thi-ee, or even four weeks. At
first, the patient feels an itching at the tip of
the ureflira, the lips of Avhich appear swollen
and of a deep rod; this is followed hy a dis-
charge of matter and great pain and scalding
in making water. In all cases of gonorrhoea,
advice should he obtained as early as possible :
early attention insures a speedy cure ; and it
may be laid down as a general rule, that the
longer the disease is allowed full scope, the
more dififtcult and obstinate is its removal.

During the progress of gonorrha?a, attention
to cleanliness cannot be too strongly recom-
mended. A warm bath should be taken occa-
sionally, and the penis should be bathed as
frequently as possible in warm -water, or milk
imd water, to destroy the acrimony of the dis-
charge, and to prevent its irritating action on
the skin. Great comfort Avill be experienced
by the patient suspending the testicles in a
small bag so as to support them while walking,
&c. This simple precaution frerpieutly pre-
vents swelled testicles, one of the most painful
effects of gonorrhoea. The diet should be care-
fully regulated in the early inflammatory stage;
the food should be light, but nutritious, and
not highly seasoned. AVines, spirits, and malt'
liquors should be a\ oided ; the patient may
drink freely of thin linseed tea, or barley-water.
The following may also be grateful: — Cream of
tartar, one oz. ; boiling Avater, two ((uarts; st rain,
and sweeten Avith lumji sugar, according lo
taste. AVe frecjucntly cure slight cases ofgon-
orrhooa in four-and-twenty hours ; others in

ahove siinple rules, our average of severe
attacks is from six to eight days.

GLEET,

In which the discharge loses its irritable malig-
nity, is of alarming consequence in its duration.
It cannot be too freciuently asserted that gk-et
is higlily c(mtagious, and produces a gonorrhoea
as siJeedily and as certainly as the more inflam-
matory disease. Gleet will remain chronic for
weeks, months, or even years, and vary in in-
tensity according io changes in diet, &c. ; so
much so, indeed, that well-informed medical
men have mistaken it for a fresh contagion of
gonorrhea, and by ti-eating it accordingly have
caused much misery to the luckless patient. In
these cases microscopic observation is of essen-
tial importance ; by its moans the true cause of
disease is at once detected, and its extent
clearly delined. (ileet and scuiinal weakness,
gonorrhoea and seminal Aveakness, arising from
sclf-pollution,are fref[uently co-existent, tbough
not necessarily connected. When they do exist
together, the disease assumes a most obstinate
form. The value of the microscope is that it
proves, Avith certainty, if spermatozoa, or the
seminal fluid, be present in the discharge or in
the urine. The treatment mvitt vary arrordingly.
A new and unsuspected feature is introduced,

whicli baffles the routine adopted by the gcnero2
practitioner. Hence the importance of a special
and careful study of these diseases. In cases
of mismanagement or carelessness, and some-
times by suddenly stopping the discharge by
means of astringent injections, an active in-
flammation of the testicles may occur, accom-
panied Avith much pain and swelling. Tlie fol-
lowing case occurred in our practice a few
months ago : — A gentleman, who had just re-
turned from a continental tour, consulted us.
Three years before he had contracted gonor-
rhoea, which terminated in gleet ; ho had been
under the care of several gentlemen, the last a
practitioner at Berlin, who prescribed an injec-
tion, which brought on swelled testicles ; be-
sides Avhich he suffered from a stricture. The
immediate pain and swelling had been relieved
by the repeated application of leeches, but the
smallest exposure to cold or dani]) lirought on
a return. The testicles felt hard, and there
was not the slightest inclination for sexual in-
tercourse. We caused, by our remedies, a very
considerable discharge from, the penis, which
we encouraged as inuch as possilde. This
soon removed the liardncss of the testicles,

and reduced them to their natural size. The
gentleuuin was perfectly cured in ten weeks.

STMCTUKE

Is generally caused by a long-continued gleet,
though there are cases in which it is produced
by Onaiiism. Tlie tlrst symptoms of a stricture
are a slight difficulty in ihe act of urinating, and
a division or twisting of the stream of water.
In all cases, however slight, apply immediately
for medical assistance. Stricture never yields

avoided by ol)serving this rule.

SYPHILIS, OK rox.

Is the. most dangerous and maligmmt of all
forms of venereal disease. It hangs aljout the
system for years, producing secondary and ter-
tiary symptoms, intense pains in the back and
loins, ulcerated sore throat, &c. In syphilis
we have a virulent blood-poison, through which
every tissue is affected. Indeed, the ooraplica-
ted mischief arising from this malady is known
only to him wlio has an opportunity of seeing
it in every shape and form under which it ap-
pears. The syphilitic disease kills great num-
bers in the prime of life, destroys the comfort

of the matrimonial bed, and transmits morbid
predispositions to declining years. To eonceal
their imprudence the inexperienced pei-mit
themselves to be surcharged Avith mercury,
which, in this varialjle climate, is liable to in-
duce the most fatal inflammations and pulmo-
nary diseases, to which they ultimately fall
victims, without creating m their families the
slightest suspicion of'ih.e real cause of their
death. A most important feature in the historv
of syphilitic diseases is the' fact of their trans-
mission from the parents to the offspring. Dr.
Burns, in his work on " MidAvifery," observes
that infection may happen when neither of
the parents has at any time any venereal swell-
ing or ulceration, and perhaps many years after
a cure has been (q^jmrenfly effected. I do not
intend to explain Jiere tlie tlieory of syphiiis,
but content myself with well-established facts."
In these cases miscarriages frequently occur
without evident cause ; or should the child be
born alive, it is covered M'ith copper-colored
spots on various parts of the Itodv ; the eyes
arc inflamed, and there is a mucous discharge
fi-om the nostrils. Should it unfortunately
survive infancy, it Avill only be to fall a prey to
scrofula or consumption at a later period. JJr.

NERVOUS EXHAUSTION. HI

Hunter records ii case of a couple who hud been
married twelve years, during which neither
party was diseased, nor had been unfaithful.
The husband had syphilis two years before
marriage, but considered himself cured. The
two first children were healthy ; the next two
feeble, and soon died ; the last child was put
out to nurse, and having a sore mouth, soon
affected the nurse Avith sore nipples,and blotches
resembling syphilitic sores. Dr. Hunter treated
both husband and wife for secondary symptoms;
the lady, who had been weakly for years, was
soon restored to vigorous health ; and three
children, who were subsequently born, remained
perfectly well. The local sores produced by
syphilis are term chancres : they are sometimes
single ; sometimes two, three, or four are pre-
senT;. " The chancre generally makes its appear-
ance four or five days after the impure inter-
course ; but, as in gonorrha?a, the time varies
from one day to thirty. A small inflamed s})ot
is first perceived, the scab drops off, and a
larger one is formed beneath, which rapidly
enlarges. An excavation appears in the centre,
the skin in the neighborhood is indurated and
thickened, the hard base being characteristic
of syphilitic sores. After some time, and even

throat, the noi^e, tne skin, the lones, are suc-
cessively attacked, and if neglected or maltreat-
ed, death may and does frequently ensue.
Syphilis, perhaps, may not be regarded as a
directly faf-al disease, altliougli its effects are so
deplorable, especially in bad constitutions. It
J8 indirectly that this disease is so very destruc-
tive to life by poisoniug and debilitating the
frame, a-nd tlius exposing it to innumerable
forms of disease. In questioning patients in
hospitals aiid dispensaries as to their previous
history, how often is it found that venereal
disease is the first link of the cluiin which is
dragging them to the grave ! Sypliilis was
firft recognized in Paris, in 1497 ; for along
time no hospit:ils would receive patients, and
tlic poorer classes of them Avei-e driven to the
woods and fields, and left to die without com-
fort or assistance, even by medical men. Some
years after, the mercurial treatment was adopt-
ed, which, with fcM' exceptions, is used at the
lircsent day. Now, it may be confidentially
asserted that as much misery has been and is
caused by the use of mercury as by the disease

Let us again urge all jiatients suffering from
syphilis in any of its forms to apply at once to
a qualified and experienced medical man. \¥e
have seen so much misery, loss of health, loss
of every enjoyment which renders life a bless-
ing, resulting from this disease, and from its
improper treatment by mercury, that we will
not countenance, even indirectly, any attempt
at self -cure.

SECOXDAKY SYMPTOMS, EFFECTS OF MERCURY, &C.

Some weeks after a chancre is apparently
healed, especially after the use of mercury in
any of its forms, a slight redness is perceived
ea the scar, which becomes rather painful ; or
a swelling appears in the g]-oin. A general
sense of. discomfort is experienced, and in a
short time the well-marked secondary symptoms
oeoir. When the poison attacks the throat or
palate, the roof of the mouth becomes red and
inflamed ; a small pimple is formed, which
ulcerates and exposes the bony palate. If al-
lowed to pass unchecked, the bone exfoliates,
a eonnection is formed between the mouth and
nose, the voice is most unpleasantly changed,



114

and an offensive discharge secreted. When the
tonsils are affected, ulcers appear similar in ap-
pearance to chancres. The soreness of the
throat is not at first very severe ; tliere is mere-
ly a slight tickling sensation when a crust or
a.ny dry food is SAvallowed. But this, if un-
checked, is one of the most severe forms of
syphilis. The larynx is next attacked, on the
top of the windpipe, and if not arrested will
soon destroy life. Eruptions of the face and
skin are one of the most comn^on scquch'a of
s.yphilis treated mercurially. They make the
skin thick, r(3ugh, and unecpud ; the counte-
nance accpiires a livid hue ; the spots are gene-
rally of a reddish, brownish, or copper color,
and appear and disappear repeatedly. The
following letter will illustrate the variotis eifects
of secondaiy symptoms : —

This gentleman was sutfering from a compli-
cated case of secondary symptoms ; he had
been salivated three times, and consequently
his system was saturated with mercury. Our
first object was to eliminate the mineral ; sec-
ond, to strengthen and invigorate the constitu-
tion. The case occupied a period of nearly
nine weeks.

CERTAISr MEA2srS BY WHICH A COHRECT KifOWL-
EDGE OF THE PATIEKT's CASE MAY BE OB-
TAINED.

The only certain means we can adoj^t for ob-
taining a knowledge of the Patient's case is by
testing the urine with our Xewl y-Co2s^structed
Microscope, with powerful Lexses. TTe
are thus able to discover two most important
points, by Avhich our treatment is greatly in-
fluenced. Firstly, we can ascertain whether
the urine contains a portion of tlie seed — that
is to say, Avhether in urinating there is a con-
stant loss of the seminal fluid. Secondly, and
of even greater importance, Avhether the ani-
.malr.nlm or spermatozoa, of w"hich the seminal
fluid is principally composed, be endued with
that vitality wifliout wliich tl/e semen, is vnfitlcd
to 2)crform its f unctions. In short, the micro-
scope enables us to ascertain whether the seed
he alive or dead. It need scarcely be observed,
that when the seed is deficient in vitality the
virile functions are greatly impaired, and the
man soon becomes impotent as well as sterile.



NERVOUS EXttAtJSTiO^r.



111^



With tlie aid of our microscoj^c we can uner-
ringly ascertain Avliether a discharge be from
the prostate gland, from the seminal vessels, or
from impure connection ; and many cases
which have been improperly treated, as gonor-
rhoea, for months, avc have thus been enabled
to cure in a week or ten days. It is our prac-
tice to request patients in the country to send
a small quantity of their urine for examination
by means of the microscope. Any patient con-
sulting us by letter will, therefore, enclose a
two-ounce flat bottle, containing the urine
passed on rising in the morning, securely corked
and sealed, packed carefully in wool to prevent
breaking, in a seidlit;? box, Avhich, with the flat
bottle, maybe obtained at any druggist's. The
parcel may be addressed, carriage paid.
Dr. L. J. Kahn,

The patient is requested to be as minute as
possible in the details of his case. Dr. Kahn

LECTURE VIII.



ON SKIN DISEASES.

Dr. Kahn has invited tlie attention of the
public and of the profession to his important
discoveries in the treatment of skin diseases ;
and, although he cannot complain that his
'vieAvs have been neglected, still the subject is
one of so great importance as to require no
apolog}^ for enlarging upon it. We all know
that for many years the remedies generally re-
lied on in these cases were arsenic, mercury
(corrosive sublimate), antimony, and caustic ;
that medical men looked upon skin diseases in
general (as too many, indeed, continue to do)
as something to be hammered at, without much
hope of relief, with all tlie most deadly drugs
of the Pharmacopoeia. The almost invariable
result Avas, and is, that even if the disease is
cured, which is exceedingly doubtful, the con-
stitution is ruined for the remained of the life.
Let any man take up a medical work on skin
diseases, and he Avill find, even now, that arsenic
is looked on as the sheet anchor, and that hun-
dreds of cases are reported in which arsenic

had failed. Now, I have carefully, and for
years, watched the results produced by this plan
of treatment. I have always found it injurions.
In many cases, after a time, there is a return of
disease worse than before, and almost invariably,
cure or no cure, I have found serious organic
mischief a^ectmg the heart or the lungs. I am
here simply stating results — results which I
have met with daily in a most extensive prac-
tice. It is scarcely worth while to enter into
causes ; for it is quite in accordance with com-
mon sense that we should expect deadly poisons
to produce deadly results. Why these particu-
lar organs should be so affected is certainly of
interest to medical men. Few diseases have
been more minutely classified and described
than the various forms of skin diseases, and it
would be easy to enumerate fifty or sixty Latin
and Greek names which have been ap})lied to
them ; but I fear the information would not be
interesting to the general reader. For myself,
I am in the habit of applying one general prin-
ciple of treatment in all the varied forms which
I see daily. My principle is simple enough and
general enough to take rank as a great dis-
covery. It is a principle I have acted upon in
practice and have advocated in public for years,



120



KERVOUS EXHAUSTION.



and certiiinl)' my success lias Ijcen most extra-
ordinary. I Avill explain it in a few words.
Let ALOi^E TRE 8kin Disease— Pt-riey the
Blood.

Instead of classifying skin disease under ten.
twenty, fifty, or a hundred heads, I find, as a
general rule, they take rank under thi-ec, and
that treatment must vary according to diag-
nosis—still acting on the golden rule, purify
the blood." Skin diseases are: —

1st. — Hereditary.

2d. — Of syphilitic origin.

^d. — Accidental, occasional, and anomalous.
Hekeditart Skin Diseases are, undoubt-
edly, difficult to cure. The impure blood of
the parent descends to the children. The re-
sult is an intractable form of disease, and the
only hope of cure is in steady, persevering
treatment. Every globule of the blood is viti-
ated fi-oni the very cradle ; and if the smallest
trace of the impurity is allowed to remain in
the system, all the labor is in vain, for the
patient in a short time will be as bad as ever
again. Hereditary skin disease is frequently
consumption or scrofula in a rather milder
form. There is no doubt in my mind of the
intimate connection between these forms of



NERVOUS EXHAUSTION-. . 131



disease. It is obvious that all local remedies
must be of uecessity ridiculous, and oven dan-
gerous. In fact, the best dressing, where there
is great irritation, is a little cold or lukewarm
water on lint. Above all, avoid greasy appli-
cations or caustics. In this, as in other forms
of skin disease, I am frequently consulted by
those who have taken sarsaparilla for months
or for years in large quantities, and desire my
opinion as to the benefit to be derived from its
use. My experience is that sarsaparilla in itself
is practically inert in cold or in temperate
climates. But it is perfectly wholesome and
harmless ; it is a pleasant drink, and a decidedly
nice vehicle for the administration of certain
drugs. On the other hand, in tropical climates,
or during exceptionally hot weather (as all
through the summer of last year), sarsaparilla
exerts a slight action upon the skin Avhich is
decidedly cooling and beneficial. In all forms
of skin disease I attach considerable impor-
tance to the use of the bath ; not that the
theory of the water-doctors will satisfy — but I
am willing to accept truth even from opponents;
and certainly their plan approaches more nearly
to the correct principle than the wholesale ad-
ministration of poisonous minerals. I may add



122



NERVOUS EXHAUSTION.



that, applying tlio same remedies, I have been
signally successful in my treatment of scrofula
and consumption. Skin diseases of syphi-
litic ORIGIN I have named as another great
class of disease ; and certainly their importance
entitles them to a rank apart. It is unnecessary
in this part of the work to allude more particu-
larly to their origin. Nor do I intend to in-
clude what we may more properly class as
'•Secondary Symptoms." In cases of disease
of the true syphilitic type there is always dan-
ger that secondary and tertiary symptoms may
ensue, especially when the patient is improperly
treated and salivated by the imprudent admin-
istration of mercury. But these cases are suf-
ficiently obvious, and any mistake in their
diagnosis is not probable, whatever there may
be in their treatment. I make this observation
because it unfortunately happens that in these,
as in the primary disease, it is far too mucli the
fashion to prescribe mercury. But skin dis-
eases of syphilitic origin may occur many years
after the original disease, and when, in fact,
till' cause is unthought of ami forgotten. They
are Ijrought on by a taint, virus-poison, or germ,
])rodnced by the original disease, and which has
reniiiineil dormant in the blood for months or

133



for years. I cannot tell you the reason of this
extraordinary phenomenon : I can only tell you
the fact. But it is easy to give an illustration
of the unexplainable effects produced by animal
poisons. A man is bitten by a dog, perhaps so
slightly as just to draAV blood. The wound
heals in a day or two, and the circumstance is
entirely forgotten. But three months, six
months, or (cases are recorded) even twelve
months afterwards, he is seized Avith hydro-
phobia, and death in a day or two is certain.
So with syphilis: the poison may remain dor-
mant for months or for years, and then, break-
ine out, cause skin diseases of the most serious
and intractable character. It is here important
to remark, that it does not necessarily folloAV
because a patient has suffered previously from
syphilis, and is afterwards affected by skin dis-
ease, that the disease is of syphilitic origin. I
have been consulted by numerous patients,
whose lives have been rendered miserable by
groundless fears, and have found, on careful
examination, no trace Avhatever of syphilitic
taint. IIoAv is it possible to discover ? may be
asked ; and my reply is, by one means and by
one means only — and that is, careful chemical
and microscopical examination and analysis ol

tlie iiriiie. My trentment of skin diseases of
syphilitic origin is precisely the same in prin-
ciple as of skin diseases generally. It is neces-
sary to bear in mind that the blood is affected
by a specific poison or virus, which must be
neutralized. Pukify the blood, and the work
is done. Accidental, Occasional, Anoma-
lous skin diseases are such as arise without a])-
parejit cause; or they may result from errors of
diet, hard living, exposure to the weather. I
have frequently seen them as the result of bad
provisions, impure water, &c., during a pro-
longed voyage. Salt food is injurious to some
constitutions. To write at length on the vari-
ous forms of disease which may be classed under
the head anomalous would exhaust far more
space than I have at command. It is obvious
that in their treatment, even more than in other
foi-ms of the disease, my dogma is the only one
consistent with common sense, truth and rea-
son ; and even at the expense of being con-
sidered prolix, I must again repeat, purify
the blood.

series of years. Its action is ])urely upon the

blood, wliicli it vitalizes, enriches, cleanses, iuid
thoroughly purifies. The consequence is, that
it is absolutely specific in all cases of skin dis-
ease, no matter from what cause arising. That
this is so isiproved by the undoubted testimony
of thousands who have used it with unfailing
effect during the last ten years. To prevent
any possibility of disapi)ointment. Dr. Kahn
Avishes it to be distinctly understood that it is
necessary to continue treatment for a certain
length of time. Skin diseases are in their na-
ture intractable and diflicult to cure ; and to
promise a rapid and permanent cure with a sin-
gle bottle of medicine would be to bring dis-
credit upon it, however valuable. But the
improvement will be found to be immediate,
and no matter how serious or of how long-
standing, the disease is certain to yield to a
proper course of the system, which is destined
to elfect a revolution in the medical treatment
of these cases, and is In truth the most impor-
tant discovery in medical science since the
introduction of vaccination by Dr. Jenner.

Many persons, Avho have imagined themselves
cured of the venereal disease, have had the
misfortune to find the disease break out again
six or seven years afterwards. A proof of this

happened in our practice lately. A gentleman
was afflicted with the complaint, and wa.scui'cd,
as he thought, by the advice and prescriptions
of an eminent surgeon. He afterwards married :
II few months after which he caught a sevei-e
cold, which terminated in a sore throat. He
applied to a medical man, who prescribed the

Having been advised to consult us, he called
upon us, and after a careful investigation, we
informed him it proceeded from an old vene-
real complaint. It was some time before he
would admit this to be the fact, and he perse-
vered with the old remedies nearly a month
longer, till at length the disease became so
serious thct he was compelled to place himself
under our care ; the rapid improvement under
our treatment was sufficient proof of the truth
of our diagnosis. We therefore recommend
extreme care that the disease be thoroughly
eradicated from the blood ; for this purpose

(Selecfions from my Case-Booh.)



In adding these cases, I may be permitted to
observe that they are selected, not becansethey
are the Avorst Avliicli liave come nnder my obser-
vation and treatment, but as being interesting
to tlie general reader, and as containing some
point likely to be nseful as an exam])le. These
cases are correct in every particular, they are
true to nature, and are a fair sample of those
which I am, and have been for years, in the
daily habit of meeting with in my extensive
practice. That my success in trea,tment has
been so uniform, I atti'ibute (under Providence)
to my extreme care in diagnosis, and to my use
of purely natural remedies, eschewing those
dangerous mineral poisons so entirely depended
on by the general pi'actitioner. It is not my
intention to add to these cases in future editions
of this work. Invfolable secreoy is the rule
of my practice, and may always be relied on. I
have uever yet published a case, excepting with

IMPORTANT NOTICE.

Patients are informed that no case is pub-

Case 1,787.

" New Orleans.
" Sir — A perusal of your excellent work has
induced me to hope you Avill be able to render
me some assistance ; I accordingl}' feel the
greatest confidence in submitting the following
case for yowx opinion and advice. I am twenty-
four years of age. At the age of fifteen I was
induced to indulge in the habit of self-abuse,
which I practised unremittingly once or twice
a day for six years. Thougli I have entirely
given up the practice for the last two years, I
am, however, suffering from its cruel effects.



NERVOUS EXHAUSTION.



129



During the time above lueiitioned I led an ex-
tremely regular life, never drank much spiritu-
ous liquor, nor had I intercourse with females.
In fact, so timid was I that I had not courage
enough to address a Avoman on the suliject. I
was remarkably short and slender ; and every
morning when I awoke, a yellowish matter
Avhich had issued from my month during tlie
night stained the pillow. I constantly com-
plained of determination of blood to the head
and of great nervousness. My sight and mem-
ory began to fail me. I felt pain over the
abdomen after each act, but was still ignorant
of the enormity of the vice and of its dii-e
effects. In tlie spring of 1807, whilst at cliurcli,
I had a rush of blood to the head, and fainted.
I was brought home and had leeches applied to
the back. The medical attendant hinted at the
practi ce of self-pollution as the cause of the
affection. This opened my eyes to the truth,
though I concealed it. My sufferings, mental
and bodily, now became dreadful. My intel-,
leotnal faculties became entirely confused. I
now became a mere skeleton. My eyes were
quite dead, and bluish streaks were perceptible
below my eyelids. I constantly staggered in
walking, and frequently was near falling. I



130

had constant dizziness in the head, and a host
of symptoms, principally from the head, for
which no one conld account. From shame, I
did not reveal my condition till, being affected
with a pain in the chest, I consulted a medical
man, and was somewhat relieved. My accu-
mulated sufferings now brought on a profound
melancholy. Travelling being now recom-
mended, I came up to Xew York, where change
of scene and plenty of exercise have worked a
great improvement in my condition ; still, how-
ever, I have severe sufferings, which I beg leave
to enumerate to you. I have involuntary
emissions of semen both when asleep and when
awake, in the company of females or before a
fire. I am affected with constant dizziness in
the head. My sense of hearing as well as that
of sight is impaired — a sort of mist before my
eyes — a kind of undulating pain in the chest.
I am entirely incapacitated for sexual inter-
course. A constant feeling of terror is con-
stantly hanging over me. Such is as accurate
an account as I can give of my present and
former state ; may I therefore solicit your im-
mediate reply to my distressing case ?

Kemakks. — If ever a subject presented him-
self for exemjilifying all the dire effects of self-
abuse, it was this individual. The order, too,
in which the disastrous consequences of this
habit were observed to follow each other, is
very remarkable, and in perfect accordance with
the pathological princijiles adyanced in the
previous jDart of this work ; in fact, this one
case would serve as an illustration of all we
have said on the subject. First, the patient
was observed to be remarkably short and slen-
der. Here we sec how the practice of self-
pollution, by disturbing and destroying in the
first instance the functions of digestion, im-
paired the growth and nutrition of the body.
The next ravages committed by it Avere on the
nervous system, and first on the hrain; the
sense of vision being impaired was a conse-
quence of this ; the disturbance of the nervous
system was also evinced by the determination
of blood to this organ. The failure of memory,
too, and of all the intellectual faculties, the
state of melancholy, so perceptible in this case,
arc further proofs of the destructive influence
of this habit. Nor was the brain the only part
of the nervous centres affected : the spinal
system also became deeply implicated, as proved



133

by the wandering pains in the chest and over
the abdomen ; the staggering gait of the patient,
the state of muscular debility into which he
was thrown, the involuntary seminal discharges,
the total inability of the patient to perform
the generative act, are still further instances of
the melancholy effects of the habit of mastur-
bation.

After impressing on this patient the absolute
necessity of abandoning this habit, which, ac-
cording to his own account he had himself done,
we undertook the treatment of the case ; and
by prescribing such medicinal and dietetic rules
as the complicated nature of the patient's con-
dition seemed to require, we succeeded, in about
two months in restoring the patient to the en-
joyment of perfect health.

iilone will save me, aiul render me liappy as a
man in this world.

I am one of those uidiappy beings who early
fell a victim to that i^ernicions an ! accursed
habit, self-]iollution, which has already rendeiX'd
me imjjotent, and it will not be long, perhaps,
before its symptoms exhibit themselves in all
their severity upon me. Would to God tliat 1
had never known this soul-destroying crime.
How happy had I been if, even after knowing
it, I had that moral restraint upon myself to
check it, as a rational being and a Christian
ought to do. I was let into knowledge of this
forbidden habit (I curse the day it was) at sucli
an eai'ly age as fourteen. I am now entering
upon twenty-four, and it will be as superfluous
as unnecessary for me to tell you to what state
these nearly ten years' indulgence in this nefa-
rious act must have reduced me. You can
divme that yourself better than I can describe.

Your little work, Avhich fell into my hands, .
providentially I think, soon convinced me of
my imin-udence, and awakened me to a true
sense of my position, and made me look, as
if with a new eye, upon the blackness of this
vice, wliich I have at last given up, I hope
forever.

The long i-ontinnuncG, however, played fill
the mischief imaginable upon me. My health
visibly gave way to it. My memory fails me,
and is no faithful companion of mine to trust.
My mind is daily sinking into a state of stupe,
faction, and is unwilling or unable to exert it-
self, and my strength is so prostrate that I feel
an utter aversion to all bodily exercise.

Yet to all outward appearance I look hearty
and strong, being corpulent ; and none, I think,
Avould suspect me as addicted to this vice, un-
less, indeed, a keen observer discover it, if that
be possible, in my eyes, which look vague and
dull. It appears to me strange that, unlike
many who were subject to this vitiating habit,
I have ample hair about my face, thick mous-
taches coming on my upper lip, and have ample
and thick whiskers ; I feel no particular pain
about back or loins Avorth mentioning. My
bowels are generally costive, testicles pendulous,
and penis rather short than of ordinary length.
I get emissions at night, on an average of per-
haps once a month.

These, sir, as I describe 1o you, are the symp-
toms as appear to me. I do not know by what

make me whole and renew }ny happiness.

destroying sexual power. After wailing a few

without interference tliis state would become

into the lijibit of sell-pollution. This, indeed,
became truly a habit, from which lie dreaded
no ill consequences, excepting from its too
frequent repetition, and generally twice a week

that relief for Avhich the sexual propensity is the
natural outlet. lie told me that he never
feared the loss of poMer, though occasionally
haunted by iU-dpJiiied nervous indigestioii, the
true cause of which never occurred to his
thoughts, and the absence of all apprehension
arose from the supposed consciousness that he
never lashed these organs to efforts for Avhich
they did not appear perfectly prone and capable.
IS'oAv, however, the tendency of this injurious
habit flashed upon his conviction in all its terri-
ble reality. It appears that during ten years
previously to his marriage he had been the sub-
ject of nocturnal eiiiif<sio)is occurring irregu-
larly, but generally once in every Aveek or ten
days ; but to this he was accustomed to attach
not the slightest importance, under the idea
that the discharge was perfectly natural, and in
no way connected with the habit of his boyhood.

domestic and matrimonial felicity, but un-
nerved for all the purposes of serious thought,
and the high duties of his sacred vocation. In
full possession of the facts of the case, and
having secured his unlimited confidence, 1 com-
menced the treatment of his deplorable infir-
mity, by the topical application of cold astrin-
i;ent washes to the enfeebled organs, with a
view to destroy the morbid irritability. Con-
joined Avith this, he steadily persisted during
two months in my course of alterative and tonic
remedies, maintaining a resolute abstinence
from all attempts at sexual gratification during
that period.

The primary effects of these restorative agen-
cies was lite entire snjyjressioii of nightly emis-
sions; and at the end of seven Aveeks desire
became so ungovernable, that, attempting in-
tercourse, my patient had the happiness to find
[lie healthy and natunil action of the genera-
tive organs entirely restored ; a circumstance
that in itself tended, by its effects upon his
joyous mind, to maintain their newly accpiirtd
power. I received a letter from him a month

Case 1,900.

Albany, ]S[, Y.
With the permission of a gentleman, whose
introduction professionally to me has termi-
nated in the formation of a lasting friendship,
I transcribe such portions of one of his letters
as will illustrate his position on his first appli-
cation to me for advice, and the results of my
treatment. He observes: "From my earliest
youth I have manifested a susceptible tempera-
ment, highly and easily excitable, and, in ref-
erence to the sex, the long-suffering victim of
passions which I never sought to control. An
ardent imagination was the bane even of my
school-days, and, in the society of youths, over
whom, as well as myself, no vigilant eye was
watchful, or perhaps evaded, I gave loose to
the indulgence of each prurient emotion as it
rose ; while feebleness, loss of appetite, and
the incipient symptoms of consumption resulted
as the disregarded indications of violence, un-

Avliat the world calls 'nervous,' and. under the
hope of recruiting my shattered constitution,
and that I might no longer he tempted to seek
for gratification in unhallowed propensities, /
determined to marry. My partner (since de-
ceased), and lately the mothar of my only child,
Avas every way worthy of manly choice, and in
the first im2)ulses of passion, and until the
charm of novelty was destroyed, I underM"ent
no uneasiness from the failure of sexual power.
This state of things did not last long. Anx-
iously hoping for offspring, and feeling hourly
that some strange change had befallen nie. ihe
dreadful truth flashed upon my tortured con-
science, and I felt that the excesses of youth,
though of slow retribution, were dreadfully
sure and painful in maturer age. And now the
long train of my nervous aihnents darkened
around me with tenfold severity : my wife's
very silence reproached me with more keenness
than open recrimination ; I cursed my very
beinc, or rather tlic weakness that had rendered
me the victim of thai early and horrible delu-
sion. I doubted of my iiowei's. weakened as

apparent cureless melancholy invested the first
years of manhood with gloom, and the pros-
pect with hopelessness ; as to the gratification
of my wish to perpetuate my name, that I hiul
long resigned as a well-merited impossibility.
My ordinary medical adviser either did not or
would not understand me, and was fain to
treat the ailment which evidently distressed
all around me upon principles which (knowing
he Avas ignorant of the true cause of such suf-
fering) only could tend to aggravate tlie mis-
chief. Under these circumstances, as I confess
with much reluctance, and with not the sligh-
test hope of benefit, I ventured, first anony-
mously, to consult you by letter. The tone of
your letter cviioldened m.e to make a personal
application, and confidence and respect became
mutual ; your manner riveted that confidence,
and from that hour I found a friend, who has
inspired the gratitude every man must feel who
has been rescued from the cold and cheerless
jaws of destruction. I followed your remedies.
I implicitly adopted your general advice, and

ultimate result, which lias been most happily

but for the circumstances previous to our union,
I might have passed, in the first years of married

ness that she saw and hailed mv returnincr

am like a holiday schoolboy next day.

I must tell you that my health and strength
are wonderfully increased ; my duties, so
wearisome before, are nmo light and easy. I
work and never lose my enei-gy, or become
wearied, hi short, I have lately felt that life is
a pleasure. Day by day I have felt better.
My friends, public and private, are surprised
to see me so well, so strong ; I am most san-
guine of future health and manly strength.

I thought the emission would never occur
again ; imaf/iiied mjselt jierfectly cured. How-
ever, the last emission was only slight, but I
felt weak in my knees, and had a feeling of
exhaustion for all the day after; but it went
off, and I felt well and strong again, and still
continue so.

The penis has assumed a much larger appear-
ance, and feels more natural and vigorous ; it
has lost that flabiiness, feels warm, and is
never clammy. I begin to feel the natural
geniality of the organs. I have rigidly adhered
to your rules and advice ; the glutinous matter
does not now escape with my urine ; my bowels
have been costive and irregular.

as also his memory ; in fact, his mind was so
absorbed in the one engrossing idea, namelj^,
that of the gratification of the yenereal appetite,
]lo^v^ increased beyond all bounds, that ho be-
came unable to devote the proper degree of at-
tention to his ordinary occupation. He now
also began to complain of pain in the upper
part of the right lung, and of considerable
difficulty of breathing on ascending an emi-
nence; these symptoms having continued for
two or three weeks, he began to perceive a sense
of heat in the top of the fauces, as also a saltish
taste in the mouth, a little after which he be-
gan to spit blood of a florid red color and frothy
appearance. Being alarmed at this, and having
for some time suspected that the cause of his
present impaired health was his inordinate in-
dulgence in venery, he called on us, and de-
tailed the history of his case, as we have now
given. On examining his chest we observed
some dullness on percussion in the upper por-
tion of the right lung, immediately under the
clavicle ; the respiratory murmur was also ab-
sent from this part ; in every other part of the
clrest the respiratory function seemed all rioht:
the action of the heart was somewhat irregular,

being very much hurried occasionally, and
from the slitrhte.st cause.

We directed that lie should forthwith abstain
from all sexual intercourse instanter, a con-
dition imperatively required for the re-es!ab-
lishment of his health ; we also prescribed a
peculiar diet, and such medicines as the nature
of the case seemed to indicate. After lacing
about three weeks under treatment, he began
perceptibly to recover his strength, his appetite
returned, as also his sleep, the pulmonary
symptoms gradually declined, the hremoptisis
had not returned after the first week he had
been under our care, the pulmonary tissue was
now perfectly pervious to air, and percussion
elicited the natural healthy sound over the
chest ; in fact, after being under treatment, in
all about six Aveeks, he was entirely restored to
health. Apprehensive, however, lest he might
return to his former inordinate indulgence, Ave
recommended his leaving New York for a
month or so and returning to his native place,
Avhich was in some part of Jersey ; he has done
so, and it is but a few days ago since we re-
ceived a letter from him announcing the perfect
restoration of his health and strength, and his in-
tention of resuming his former cmiiloyment.

E-EMAKKs. — This was a case where conside-
rable difficulty presented itself ; a jiatient ex-
hausted in strength, with a very serious affec-
tion of the lung, for the relief of Avhich de-
pleting measures appeared necessary. It is
evident, however, that if such treatment was
carried to any extent in this case, the patient
must sink ; thus, then, Ave had to restore
strength, and, at the same time, to combat in-
flammatory symptoms of rather an alarming
nature. By closely watching from day to day
the effects of our remedies, we finally succeeded
in gradually restoring the strength, and at the
same time in keeping down inllammation by
the local api3lication of counter-irritants.

Case 1,387.
A. E. M., about twelve months before seeing
us had contracted gonorrhcea from a casual
connection. A slight discharge and scalding
made their ai^pearance about seven days after
the intercourse. The age of this gentleman
was 32, and although he had led a very free life,
he had never before contracted disease. His
occupation was head-salesman and manager of
a large mercantile house ; his pursuits active ;
he was a man of great energy, clever in busi-

11688, well educated, and of social habits ; un-
married ; temperament nervous-sanguine. Of
course lie knew very well what was the disease,
and without loss of time consulted a physician,
a friend of his, in large practice. Wishing to
cut short the disease as soon as possible, the
doctor ordered large doses of balsam copaiva
and cubebs, and also applied an injection of
nitrate of silver. These active measures seemed
at first to produce the desired effect. The dis-
charge, w4iich had never been very copious, was
decidedly lessened ; but the patient complained
somewhat more of the scalding and pain in
urinating. The treatment was continued a
few days longer, but the discharge remained
and the pain increased. He also found con-
siderable irritation of the bladder— so that he
•was unable to hold his urine for any length of
time. There w^as also much heat and inflam-
' mation about the penis, and small red pustules
beo-an to make their appearance on the body,
causing intolerable irritation. The appetite
was lost, and, in addition, whatevc was eaten
caused sickness and indigestion. The stomach
revolted entirely from the medicine, which,
when taken, was immediately rejected. His
friend now discontinued treatment, and ordered

w arm l)Mtlis and mild aperients. Some six or
.'^cven weeks had gone by, and A. E. M. found
liimself, as far as the disease was concerned,
certainly no better, but in addition greatly re-
duced in strength, and his digestion so seriously
impaired that his stomach could not bear any-
thing in the shape of medicine. A temperate
drinker before, he had entirely given up all his
usual stimulants, having been so advised liyhis
friend. For a week or two longer, sometimes
a little better, at other times a little worse, he
still continued taking medicine when he could
stand it, occasionally trying a mild injection
The discharge was thick and greenish ii'i color'
scanty in quantity— the nut of the penis and
the hps of the urethra blood-red. The pain in
urinating now became extreme, and one day
havnig been much on his feet, he found to-
wards evening, that he was compelled to pa,ss
unne every five minutes. He ha,d l)ecn snfT'er-
ing from severe pain in the back all throucdi
the day, and he felt himself so ill that he im-
mediately undressed, went to bed. and sent for
one of the first surgeons in the city of New
York. It proved that inflammation of the
bladder had set in, and so much had the patient
been reduced, and so obstinate was the case

ihid it Avus three months hefore lie was able to
rise from his bed. But A. E. M.'s troubles
Avere not yet ended. After the inflammation
Avas reduced, a A ery copious urethral discharge
came on, Avhich the surgeon very properly en-
couraged by every means in his poAver. It noAV
became important to endeavor to stop this dis-
charge, Avhich Avas attempted carefully and ten-
tatively. Just as it Avas stopped, and the pa-
tient Avas congratulating himself that his dis-
ease Avas cyred, the left testicle began to swell,
and so great Avas the pain and inflammation,
that hc Avas again obliged to take to his bed.
Another month, Avhen the other testicle Avas
attacked. The treatment adopted Avas leeching,
cold lotions, and aperients. It Avould be tedious
to continue the history of this case. Suflice it
to say, Avhen Ave Avere consulted we found con-
siderable discharge, Avhich, directly it Avas
checked, caused immediate swelling of one or
both testicles, obliging the patient to lay up,
the slightest exertion or exercise causing intole-
rable pain. What Avas to be done ? I must
confess this case required deep consideration,
•md when I heard the history, I felt some mis-
givings as to the result. At first I thought it
possible that some complication m the form of



NERVOUS EXHAUSTlOJv.



157



seminal discluii-gc might be present ; hut a
careful microscopic analysis convinced mo that
such Avas not the case. The discharge was
purely gonorrho^al, and although so long a time
had elapsed since the infection, strange to say,
there was no stricture. Seeing that the patient
was so much reduced, I determined to act
against all the usual laws of medical men in
the treatment of generative inflammation and
urethral discharges. I prescribed powerful
tonic treatment, and ordered in addition at
least two bottles per diem of the best London
porter. Although the discharge was copious,
and the pain in urinating very severe, so much
was the patient reduced and weakened, that I
determined at all risks to improve his general
health and condition, even if the local disease
were thereby increased. But such was not the
result. I saw him daily, and from the first
hour improvement set in. The diet and medi-
cine together caused a visible alteration from
day to day. At the end of a week all pain in
urinating, and all tendency to inflammation,
had left him. During a month the character
of the discharge gradually changed, and,
though no special remedies were employed, the
quantity greatly diminished. I*.now found the

patient well enough to attempt cauu<jusly to
stop the flow. In tliis I succeeded in ten days,
keeping np the medicine a Aveek or no longer,
lest there should he a return, though I did not
fear it. But everything Avent on Avell, and I
discharged A. E. M. thoroughly cured, and in
a perfectly sound, healthy condition, within
six Aveeks of his first consultation. From tha^.
•day to the present time there has been no re-
turn of the disease, and no unpleasant symp-
toms whatever.

Eemakks.— It is very frequently supposed,
especially by young men, that gonorrh(!_':i is a
disease of little or no consetpienee. There is
no doubt but that occasionally a cure may be
very easily effected. On the other hand, there
are constitutions to which one dose of the reme-
dies Avhich are so generally used will act as a
virulent poison. To discriminate one from the
otlier requires the acute instinct of the educated
medical observer. In my hands the ''abortive"
treatment of gonorrhcea, by which a cure is
frequently effected within three d:iys, has
proved invariably successful. AVliy ? Because
I never attempt it, except in cases whicli my
experience tells me arc amenable to thai vigor-
ous treatment. -And surely it is better to take

a Aveck to cure, if necessary, than adopt treat-
ment nearly certain to fail, and which must, in
case of faihire, protract the disease for a lengtli-
cned period. Another Aveek of the "usual
remedies" must have cost A. E. M. his life,
and when I first saw him I did not feel by auy
means certain that I could restore him to health.

Case 4,798.

" Boston, Mass.
"Sir — The critical and pressing circum-
stances in which I find myself ^Dlaced oblige me
urgently to solicit your immediate attention
to this my communication. I shall give as
briefly as possible the history of my case. I
am now in the forty-fifth year of my age, and
have never been married. I begin to find my-
self less vigorous in my embraces, and less in-
clined, because less able, to repeat them. I also
experience pains in the lower part of the spine,
gleety discharge, occasional dizziness in the
head, and, Avhen at stool, emissions of semen.
At first, and for considerable time, I took no
notice of these things, and did not at all sus-
pect the causes which could have given rise to
them. I happened, hoAvevcr, to read in a medi-
cal work, some time since, an Mlusion made to



160

these symptoms wliicli I have stated tliat I felt,
and some (certainly ohsci:re) reference to im-
perfect coition and premature secession from
the female as their prohahle cause. I then
consulted your hook, and found that the real
cause of my symptoms, which have since, hy
the way, hecome much aggravated, Avas to he
referred entirely to the hahit in which I had
been for so many years indulging. As I wish
to he as minute as possible in this my commu-
nication to you, I find brevity impossible. I
therefore must speak a little in detail : For the
last three years I experienced a sort of tremor
under mental agitation, whether such agitation
be occasioned by ordinary business (I am a
merchant) or by venereal feelings. Th is ti-emor
is only occasional, but its recurrence is very
frequent, especially of late. I am becoming
less confident every day of my virile powers,
for I find them much deteriorated. I have
lived a bachelor up to my present time, have
never been diseased with syphilis, and have
now a very excellent opportunity of an extreme-
ly good match with a young lady somewhat,
nay, considerably younger than myself. One
thing only deters m6 from marrying— debdity
of the genital organs, and premature emission

of semen. I liave endeavored to make my case
as open to you as possible. It is witliin your
]iower, or the power of medicine, to restore me
to anything like adequate strength to consum-
mate tlie act of coition ? I am nervous — I am
afraid. Write to me as soon as possible your
opinion, and if you think medicine cau relieve
me, send it to me immediately. The occasion
is urgent — that must plead my apolog^^. I en-
close fee. If you restore me to the state in
which a husband is expected to be, I shall
gladly acknowledge it, and remunei-ate you
handsomely. Yours obediently, R. S. T.''

"Di^AR Doctor— I luive, I know, worried
and teased you very much ; but you know too
much of the Avretched state of a man's mind,
circumstanced as I was, till I consulted you, to
feel annoyed at my unceasing importunities and
interrogatories. I now find myself comiDletely
set to rights— everything as it should be—
healthy and vigorous. I no longer feel any
delicacy in undertaking the duties and respon-
sibilities of a husband. Prom your assiduous
and truly scientific directions and medicines, I
am to be married in two or three days. Ought
I not continue your last bottle a little longer ?

Case 1,236.

A gentleman of about thirty years of age, who
was studying for the bar, consulted me in order
to know if I thought it possible I could ever
restore him to a vigorous state of health. He
had, he said, when a boy, been taught the hor-
rible habit of self-pollution by one of his
father's stable lads, witli Avhom he, boy-like,
used to ramble about the stables and grounds,
and this practice he had continued even long
after both his Judgment and his health had
warned him to desist ; in fact, he told me he
was ashamed to say that it was only by slow
degrees that he had succeeded in obtaining tlie
mastery of himself, and that ho had only very
recently been able completely and utterly to
abstain. So firmly had the vice fixed itself
upon him, that, even after he had made the
strongest resolutions, tlie mere sight of anything



NEEVOUS EXHAUSTION.



in the least calculated to excite amatory feeling,
or the reading of the most innocent paragraph
in a newspaper or book, suggestive, even in the
most remote way, of sexual enjoyment, was
sufficient to scatter his good intentions to the
winds, and cause him to seek the earliest oppor-
tunity of solitarily gratifying his most odious
propensity. While mentioning these and other
circumstances with the utmost candor, he told
me at the same time that no mere bodily suf-
fering or ordinary consequences of his vicious-
ness would have induced him to undergo the
pain of thus unbosoming himself, and of mak-
ing the disgraceful confession, were it not for
two circumstances. One of these was, that un-
less he could get absolutely cured, he was de-
prived of all hope of his being able to succeed
in his profession ; and the other, that having,
for not less than seven years, been engaged to
a young lady of great personal beauty and
highly cultivated mind, between whom and
hmiself the warmest attachment subsisted, the
time was speedily approaching when either he
must entirely debar himself her society, and
leave her to imagine him (without power of
explanation on his side) one of the basest and
most insulting of men, or fix some period.



164

however remote, for their marriage, as the po-
sition in life of both parties were such that no
obstacle existed to their union. This he very
properly declared he never would assent to
while in his present condition — and a frightful
condition it was. Although stout in body, his
face was thin, hollow, and cadaverous ; his flesh
was flabby, the scrotum was hanging loose, his
limbs Avere weak, his hands unsteady and trem-
bling, his breath Avaa so short that he dared not
take even a short walk ; he had pains in his
back and loins, besides a variety of other symp-
toms. He found, moreover, that a gradual
incapacity for study had for a long time been
creeping over him, a confusion of ideas, an im-
possibility of fixing his attention upon any sub-
ject, and a constant state of wavering uncer-
tainty, restlessness, and disquiet, the sure fore-
running symptoms of mental imbecility. Un-
der these circumstances he entreated my aid, if
it was at all possible for that aid to be success-
fully exerted. I undertook the case, and
although the evils I had to eradicate were deep
seated and of long standing, I at length, by
])erseverance and a careful study of his consti-
tution and ailments, succeeded in etfecting his
restoration to ix state of thorough health and

Case 2,572.
A gentleman, a large manufacturing chemist,
called upon me early iii May, 1862. He was
suifering from a severe case of secondary symp-
toms. About three months previously, after a
casual connection, he had- noticed chancres ;
and having studied medicine, his business, too,
giving him a first-rate knowledge of drugs, he
thought he could soon cure himself. He there-
fore began to take blue pills, with a lotion of
sulphate of copper. He was slightly salivated,
but the chancres healed, and he Avas delighted
to find himself quite well. But, ten days be-
fore seeing me, secondary symptoms broke out
with the greatest virulence. His throat was
severely attacked ; spots broke out all over his
body ; his hair fell oft (a common elfect of
mercury), and his constitution seemed com-
pletely shattered. I also found, on careful
examiiuition and analysis of his urine, that he
was suffering from spermatorrlicea— in fact
there Avas a loss of seed every time he passed
water. As Avas to be expected, the seed was

diseased ; iu fact, sypliilis had affected even*
tissue aud secretion of tlic Ijody. The case re-
(|uired prompt treatment, and for three or four
(hiys the disease continued to make head against
Llie medicine. However, I am happy to add
that I soon controlled it, and in the course of

seven Aveeks Mr. was perfectly restored to

health and ^•igor.

Case 2,5'JG.

Philadelphia.
Captain M. A., three months before consult-
ing me, had observed a small pimple under the
})repuce or foreskin, after a casual connection.
Having rubbed it off, it was succeeded by
another, rather larger, when, thinking it was
"tlie heat of the hody," he took mild aperient
medicines. It remained stationary for some
weeks, and then began to increase rapidly ; he
also noticed a large swelling in each groin.
Becominc: alarmed, he determined, by the ad-
vice of a friend, a brother ofhcer. to consult
]ue ; but, unfoi'tunately, urgent business de-
tained him some days longer. I immediately
saw that the case Avas very serious ; the poison
had acquired terrible virulence by remaining so
long in the body, and, in spite of the most

powerful remedies, lie eoiUiniiod to get worsQ
for some days. The chiincres progi'essed so
rapidly as to threaten the entire loss of the
penis, and both bnboes burst, leaving a large
cavity in each groin. However, l)y the most
energetic means, he-was brought under the in-
flnence of the medicines, and liegau to impi'ove,
though at first very slowly. This case re(]uired
three months' constant attention before a cure
was effected, and even then it was necessary to
prescribe strengthening medicines for some
weeks longer. I instance this case to prove tlie
importance of an early application in case of
syphilis. Had the patient applied to me in tlic
first instance, one week's attention wonld ha\ e
been quite sufficient to insure a thoi-ough cure,
without pain or annoyance. I have lately re-
ceived a letter from Captain M. A., stating that
he is now thoroughly Avell, and as strong as
ever.

PICTURE FIRST : THE Y0UNC4 SENSUALIST.
" The g\ovy of a. young- man is bis strength."

In the great battle of life there is need that
each combatant should have a brave heart and
vell-braccd nerves, for the fight is long and
arduous, and the weak and timid have no chance
therein. Nor is the work all toil : the high
endeavor — the end in view — makes of it a
]ileasure, and as we watch the busy passers-by
in the broad thoroughfares of the city, every
face seems eager and earnest. No, not every
face. Here comes one, alone — a solitary one.
He is young, hut he has none of the busy char-
acteristics of his fellow men. Listless in his
manner, timid in his air, he Avanders rather
than Avalks through the croAvded street. Maybe
he is a clerk, or a student, or a mechanic. But
why is he so vacant and so sad ? It is but three
or four short years since, Avith a father's bless-

himself u man." Then his nerves were firm,
his mind m-us biujyant, his step was light, and
iiis hopes were liigh. But these few short
years lia\e Avrouglit a sad and fearful change.
NoAv neither hope nor ambition finds a place in
his bosom. The fresh vigor of his youth is
replaced by a weariness of life, even while his
foot is yet but on its threshold. See hoAV vacant
and objectless is his gaze ! His hand wanders
to his forehead, wiiich it feverishly presses,
whilst a deep sigh escaping him tells of nervous
exhaustion, and of a mind brooding over dark-
ling thoughts. If you knew him as a child
you are struck Avith the change. Then he was
robust and stout ; noAV he is thin and pale.
Then his eye Avoiild flash fire, as he dashed with
energy into some boyish game ; now he turns
aside from old companions.and frowns on what.
Avcre once delights. And, hark ! that hectic
cough that shakes his frame, exhausts his
breath, and tells of an uiidermined constitu-
tion, and, i)erhaps, of the dread apjiroach of
consumption.* 8peak to him. What says he ?

He has been ill, and growing Avorsc for a year
or so. He ciiniiot nccount for it, and the doc-
tor docs not seem (o do him any good, or to

eyes arc weak a-nd his memory gets very bad."
Poor fellow! It is a sad tale. Is there n»
solution ? Yes ; come with me.

It is nio-ht time. He has retired to his bed.
Let us lift the veil of night, and gaze on him
when he fondly fancies that no eye is upon him.
Does he sleep the sleep of conscious rectitude-
enjoy the Avelcome repose of a self-satisfied
mind ? No, alas ! What tempest of passion—
what hurricane of lust is this that sweeps across
his soul ! Why do liis strained eye-balls glare
on vacancy ? Why docs his cheek flush now
like fire, now become pallid as death ? Why
docs his poor heart now beat as if it w^ould
burst through its tenement of flesh and bone,
and anon scarce indicate a fitful pulse ? And
now, why does he sink, sighing and exhausted,
helpless and almost lifeless on his pillow ? The
fearful truth is all revealed. Sensuality has
only too faithfully painted its deep lines on his
body and mind. The picture is only too com-
plete. Before you lies a poor, self-destroying,
self-debauching, nerveless, joyless Onanist.

readers exclaim, "but surely a little over-

sternness with which these evils haunt the foot-
steps of those who persist in tlie praclice,
whether wilfully or ignorantly. The following
description of his case Avas written to me some
years ago by one who is now a happy husband
and father : —

" I was well and happy nntil the age of fif-
teen, when I learnt the habit from a companiun

from morning till night. My eyeballs ache and
throb ; I suffer acutely when I pass water ; my
groins seem weak, so tliat I cannot enjoy exer-
cise. When it is morning, I long for the night;
and then, what nights I pass ! Lascivious
dreams disturb my }'est ; my sleep is fitful and
nnref resiling. Long hours I lie awake, fre-
qnently in a profuse perspiration, reflecting on
my awful condition, and my thoughts em-
bittered by the knowledge that surely my 'sin
has found me out.' Oh ! sir, as you hope for
blessings here and hereafter, exert your utmost
skill to rescue from destruction a blighted
wretch.''

This is a picture drawn by the hand of a suf-
ferer. A few short weeks more, perhaps, and
his application to me Avould have been in vain.
Ilis constitution would have been utterly ruined.

Again, had ho applied to a general prac-
titioner, Avho lacked the special opportunities I
have now for thirty years enjoyed of studying
the intricacies of these cases, he would probably
long ago have been consigned to the grave,
instead of surviving, as ho does, in health,
honor, and happiness.

In every community tliere are many middle^

not assumed the responsibilities of married life.
It may be tliey liave failed to secure one M-hom
tliey have fondly loved in youth ; it may be tliai
they have determined to secure a higher position
and a more assured income before marriage.
As a general rule these men are hard-working,
energetic men of business, strictly temperate,
well educated, saving in their habits, and higlily
esteemed in society. But there are amongst
them others altogether different— men of shy
habits and downcast looks, sometimes of morose
and peevish minds. In what should be the
very prime of their life they find their consti-

fears that manhood, vigor, mental and bodily,

this is true. Every rule tending to health and
happiness has heen ohserved, save one. Under-
stand, my friend, the blood is the life. Do
you know that one ounce of the semen is eqniva-
Jent to TPORTY ounces of blood? Be no longer
ignorant — you are answered. The secret sin —
the sin of Onan— has been draining your heart's
blood for years. Be assured that no man can
commit evil without evil consequences — for
" Sorrow tracketh wrong forever and ever."

When the constitntion is healthy and vigor-
ous, it may resist the consecpicnces for years ;
but the nltimate effect will be all the more
a^^ravated. The vital force, unable to bear
tlie Avaste of more than life, gives way suddenly.
The healthy middle-aged m:i.n becomes a con-
firmed invalid. Worse — infinitely Avorse is it
Avhen such a man ignorantly marries. I re-
member such a case. The gentleman Avas

his mental activity and unblemished integrity.

IIg was a personable man, stout of limb, healthy
m appearance, but a confirmed private sensua-
list. Years had passed since he first addicted
himself to the unfortunate habit— yet hitherto
his system had resisted the constant drain upon
its vital resources. Not that he has been with-
out warnings. Sometimes a failing eye, a wan-
dering mind, an unwilling stomach, jierchance
restless nights, and vague discomfort. He
soothes his conscience, and says,''-'I work too
hard, I have indigestion, I Avill take a holiday. "'
And now he thinks it is time he should marry.
His position is assured — he is a wealthy man—
his ambition is satisfied, and he will seek to bo
hai)py. He is to all outward appearance an
acceptable husband ; his character is beyond
reproach. He only knows of one disreputable
phase which disfigures it, and that he deter-
mines to abandon forever, in order that he mav
be fit for the pure and virtuous embraces of his
bride-elect. His sin has found him out ; those
Avho will not be Avarned must be punished ;
unhappily, too, tlie innocent must suffer also.
He marries, and on the nujitial couch, in tlio
arms of her he loves, he— poor self-deluded,
self-ruined sensualist — discovers that the vigor
of manhood has departed from him forever !

PICTURE THIRD: THE MARRIED SENSUALIST.

The sacred ordinance of marriage emanates
from the Deity, by whom we are enjoined to
"mcrease and multiply." Hence it is con-
sidered honorable amongst all men, and should
not be entered upon carelessly or Avantonly, nov
without duly considering the causes for wliich
Jt was originally ordained. A happy marria,o-e
IS the bond of social purity, as it is the crown
of domestic joys. But it frequently happens
that young men injure themseh-es seriously—
and even permanently-by the lengths to which
during the first year or two after marria^-e, they
carry the indnlgence-or, to speak more accu-
rately, the coercion-of the sexual faculties,
ihose who have never had the advantage of
friendly advice are apt to make serious mistakes
as to the extent to which intercourse should
take place.

Let me warn the newly married couple of the
dangers of excessive indulgence, which not only
ruins the health, but soon renders intercourse
utterly repugnant. In such a case, when the
vn-ile powers of the man fail him, and he no
longer discharges with alarcity and effect the
duties of a husband, the wife, not knowino-



178 NERVOUS EXHACSTIOX.

that she herself contributed to his impotoncy,
but feeling a lack of warmth and vigor in his
embrace— if not an absolute incapacity for
sexual duties— begins to believe that it is else-
where he seeks for gratification ; and jealousy
and discord mar domestic peace.

It is my solemn duty, therefore, to entreat
those newly-married, who may have "' over-
stepped the modesty of nature," to pause ere
the knell of all their mutual joys boom forth
in the solemn words, " Too Late ! "-and to
take steps to counteract the evils they have,
perhaps unwittingly, invoked. Ten mniutes
advice and instruction, added to skilful and
mild treatment for two or three weeks, are
often sutTicient in these cases to restore tone to
the debilitated organs, and renew, as it were,
the bonds of love between husband and wife.
The lesson, too, proves valuable, and is not
often forgotten.

But there is another and more frequent cause
of matrimonial unhappiness— a cause to which
I have already directed attention.

Subjects of grave and painful importance re-
ciuire plain and intelligible language. I ^viU
therefore say, emphatically, that the destrm.-
tivc habit of self-abuse, practised in early life,



XJ^KVOITS EXHAUSTION. J 79

fearfully injures the energies concerned in the
reproduction of our species, and the due fulHl-
ment of the nuptial rite. And it unfortunately
happens that a man may abandon self-abuse as
a voluntary act, and yet not be free from the
consequences of his former folly. A new and
unnatural association has been established be-
tween the organs of generation and the mind
—involuntary discharges of semen take place
during sleep ; the seed is lost in the urine, at
sfool; and muscular fibres surrounding the
seminal ducts become relaxed, and all control
over their actions is entirely lost. Let not any,
then, imagine that having incurred the judg-
ment of guilt they shall wholly escape the
penalty, unless by prudent and prompt action,
and attention to skilled advice, the instant the
knowledge of that guilt and the certainty of its
fearful consequences occur to them, they adopt
the only measures by which the scourge can be
averted. Therefore let us solemnly warn any
young man now contemplating marriage, and
who may at times have indulged in the secret
vice of the solitary sensualist, not to take upon
himself the s;icred obligations and responsi-
bilities of a husband until he is fully satisfied
that his blood, his nervous system, and hig

procreative powers arc free fro,u the
effects of his past indulgence.

Of all the pitiable phases presented by the
practice of self-abuse, none is so pitiable as
that of the man wlio, havin,cr lieen l)ereft of the
])artner of his bed and lioine, aJ.aiuh.ns himself
to the tyranny of self-lust, and thus lu-ocipi-
tates himself into a dark and dismal ^ulf of
boddy and mental affliction.

Some time since, I Avas visited by a middle-
aged man, ^vho desired to consult me. and
]ieard from him the following- extraordinary
statement : —

_ He was a respectable tradesman, in business
m Brooklyn. Twenty-seven months ago he had
unfortunately lost his wife, to whom he was
much attached. He had been married to her
about fourteen years, and was left with a family
of eight children. His circumstances were
prosperous: he had a good business, and lived
comfortably and well. He assured me most
solemnly that during his wife's life he had
never once been unfaithful to her. Shortly
after her death, he began to feel himself nu.ved
'J the passions of sexuality. He endeavored
o resist the influence ; for havingbcen faithful
o his wife during life, he had resolved to honor
bor virtues and love by remaining faithful to
ber memory after death. Over and above which

ho had an uttcv abhorrence of the evils of pro-
miscuous sexual intercourse ; and had also fully
determined never to bring to his children a
step-mother, who might probably — however
careful his selection— prove anything but a
second mother to them. His only hope, there-
fore Avas a resolution to resist the strong
proiuptings of sexual desire. This he did for
some time, but eventually, and unhappily, his
resolution gave way, and in an evil moment he
took to the practice of self-pollution.

In this practice he found a means of ridding
himself of the irritating sexual secretion ; and
totally unconscious of the danger to his health
-nay, his very life-involved in the practice,
he continued in unrestrained indulgence of the
mad passion for a considerable time.

Of late, however, he had felt his health and
strength giving way ; his nights had become
sleepless ; ■ and he had almost constantly in-
dulged in the practice in order to procure
sleep But the sleep resulting had at all times
been feverish, fitful, and accompanied with
dreams of the most unpleasant kind

He had also lost all relish for food-was ab-
sent-minded and remiss in business, and felt
'that premal.uv ohl ago was fast creeping up..n

him. He had consulted his usual family doctor
who had attributed his ill-health to the indul-
gence of silent grief for the loss of his wife
and to the worry and anxiety of an increasinc^
business. Up to this time not a thought had
ever crossed his mind that self-abuse was the
cause of his misfortune. He happened, how-
ever, to come across one of my works on Ner-
vous Debility/' and reading it carefully, was at
once struck with the knowledge of the fact.
He lost not an instant, but immediately leaving
his house, hastened to consult me, and placed
himself under treatment that very night.

On examination,— and especially on making
a careful analysis of his urine,— I found this
patient very much debilitated, and the genera-
tive organs functionally deranged. I also saw
enough to be able to inform him, in the most
positive manner, that if he persisted any fur-
ther m the practice of self-abuse, his nervous
system would entirely break down, and the
attributes of manhood be lost to him forever.

Never was there a more docile patient And
consequently, he was under treatment a very
short time before he began to take heart I
could tell, by the increased buoyancy of his air
every time he visited me, that he was in the



184 NERVOUS EXHAUSTION.

way of rapid improvement. He was all but
restored to bis former health. I induced hini
to substitute a regular and restrained hal)it and
diet for his former free living; and instead of
his business being— as his former adviser told
hiin__a source of misery and ill-health, he
found in it a relief, and a healthy and pleasu-
rable mode of maintaining the vigor and

serenity of his mind and body.

This is not a solitary case— many such have

come under my observation ; and even now can

I recall one which had not a termmation so

favorable.

Argument and entreaty were alike without
■ivail The habit, relinquished for a week, was
acain and again indulged in. As the constitu-
tion became more and more impaired, so the
powers of the will decayed. Business and
pleasure alike lost their hold on his memory,
his thoughts or his appetite ; and a few short
months saw him consigned-harmless enough,
to be sure-to a private lunatic asylum, where
he finished the miserable remnants of his days
in the darkness and dimness and dospan- of a
living death.

PICTURK fifth: the sceptic sensualist.

I can imagine one of my readers, wlio lias
glanced with rapid eye over the preceding pages,
M'ho may exclaim sotto voce, " Ay, ay, doctor ;
it is all very well, and I dare say there are some
^\vo or three in a million to whom tJiese facts
and descrijjtions apply, but they apply to very
few ! I believe that a man may practice self-
abuse for years, and really suffer no evil conse-
cpiences. I know tbat 1 have no time, no
means, nor opportunity of indulging myself in
the pleasures of a connubial life, and I have
resorted to this habit to relieve myself of the
promptings of nature, and I am neither sick
nor diseased ; I have had none of the evils yon
speak of, and I don't think I ever shall."

My reply is, " Gently, my friend ; do not
dra\v rash conclusions. Listen patiently for a
few minutes, and I think you will own yourself
in tbe wrong." If you are an Onanist ; if you
have at any time abandoned yourself to that
vice, Avhich has been aptly called "adultery of
the mind," / defy tjou to ftay Irtilhfulhj that you
have not experienced effects more or less evil.
I challenge you, as an honest man, to say
whether you Inive not had your warnings ? I

beg of yolu specially you, sceptical roader. —
infatuated abuser of yourself, — to answer to
your OAvn soul, in truth and sincerity, a few
questions of solemn import touching the effects
of self -abuse, not on another man, but on your-
self — on your own precious body and mind. —
Answer them truly, seriously, in the solitude of
your own chamber, and tliink ere you reply.
Are you an Onanist ?

In pursuit of the baneful and degrading prac-
tice of self-abuse, have you ever felt it to be a
sinful practice — unmanly, unchristian, and de-
grading you l)eneath the level of the brute
beast, Avhich in following the mere promptings
of instinct never falls so low ?

Have you ever yet oxce practised it without,
in tbe very act, making up your mind that you
would never repeat it ?

Do you suffer from involuntary nocturnal
emissions ? Are you ever troubled with erec-
tions without apparent cause, failure of erection
when desired, or premature discharge of semen
during coition ?

Have you dull pains in the groin, pains in
the back ? Does your sight fail you ? Have
you nervous headucho ?



JN'KKVOI S EXHAUSTION. 187

Are you subject to pimi^les ou llie face, l)ack,
or forehead ?

Do you suffer from a hacking ct)iig]i, for
Avhich all remedies seem uiuivailine: ?

Are you fatigued with the slightest exertion,
and does lassitude of body and mind overtake
you without cause ? Are you restless when fa-
tigued, and unable to obtain refreshijig slumber?

Have you lost energy, appetite, i)ower of en-
joyment ? Are you frequently averse to society,
even of intimate friends ? bashful in female
society, unable to join in conversation ?

Does ■ your memory fail you ? arc all your
senses blighted ?

Do you fall iiito dreamy fits of abstraction,
brooding over the past, hopeless as to the future
—all the noble aspii-ations forgotten which
gilded the morning of your career ?

Honestly, thoughtfully, mournfully recalling
your past life, are you not certain that your
health would have been better, your heart
stouter, your hopes brighter, your mind and
thoughts purer, more dignified, and manly, if
you had not acquired for yourself your o^vn self-
reproach ?

Let the victim of his own evil passions ansM^er
these questions, among a thousand such as I



188

could propose to him. Answer them truly,
honestly, and witliout mental reservation, as
between Heaven and his own conscience. And
if the answer to them, or any part of them,
be the one emphatic ''Yes," how Avill he dare
to say that he has indulged his vile appetite for
solitary excess without experiencing some of its
attendant evils ?— without having had emphatic
warning that his sin is finding him out, and
that days and nights of woe and torture are
now impending, unless he accepts the Avarniug.
and reverently retraces his steps from the evil
path he has chosen ?

Let him, therefore, earnestly endeavor to lead
a new life, lest in the future day, as he has sown
the storm so will he reap the whirlwind. When
the tempest of passion and of lust shall haxc
left him, bereft of all but an enfeebled mind,
and a body racked— preyed upon by the tor-
tures of a memory bitterer even than death.

But I hope that many who read this will turn
from their error, that truth will prevail, that their
conscience will be awakened— alas ! so many en-
through ignorance. And if this little book is in-
strumental in saving even oxe who would other-
wisehave been lost, from evils leading to destruc-
tion,! am aniply rewarded— it has not been writ-
ten in vain.

PICTURE SIXTH: THE PROMISCUOUS SENSUALIST.

Nearly four centuries ago, the swarthy sailors
of Columbus, returning from the enterprise
which added another hemisphere to the known
Avorld, brought Avith them that terrible plague
which has since been one of the curses of civ-
ilized life —

SYPHILIS.

It is not my intention to write at large on
this subject ; for fuller information I must re-
fer my readers to my work on "Nervous De-
bility."

The most mysterious characteristics of this
disease, and the most to be dreaded, is that by
poisoning the blood and tissues, it entails misery
years and years after the patient has been api)a-
rently cured. And not alone on himself— the
poison being absorbed in the blood becomes
hereditary, even to the third and fourth gene-
rations. As much to be dreaded as the disease
itself is the mercurial treatment almost univer-
sally adopted by the general practitioner for its
cure. I do not hesitate to assert that more
carious bones, diseased brain, and shattered
constitutions have been produced by the ex-



190



NERVOUS EXHAUSTION.



hibition of this poisonous miueral than by the
disease itself.

Let me in all cases earnestly advise any man
suffering from disease not to attempt self-cure.
Let him at once apply for assistance to one in
whom he can place confidence — and more es-
pecially to one who has made a specialty of
these cases. It is not sound sense and reason,
that one whose practice is devoted to a particu-
lar complaint should better know how to cure
than one who may see half-a-dozen cases by
mere chance in twelve months ? One warning
and I have done. A young man, having con-
tracted a venereal taint in his single career, not
knowing of any impediment, may marry, and
innocently be the means of fastening upon his
otTspring manifold evils — and thus render his
own and wife's, as well as their lives, an intole-
rable misery and burden. Tliis ought to be
guarded against in every instance by a consul-
tation, when marriage is contemplated.



Notice to Patients and Invalid Readers.



Dr. L. J, Kaiin, having- for many years ex-
clusively devoted his attention to the treatment
of the diseases of the generative and ner-
vous SYSTEM described in tlie preceding pages,
may be consulted personally from ten in the
morning till two, and from five in the evening
till eight, daily, at his permanent residence,
51 East Tenth Street, between University
Place and Broadway.

The following directions are given to all who
desire to consult Dr. Kahn : —

1. The hours of consultation are from 10 A. M. till 2, and from
etoSP. M.; on Sundays till 2 P.M., at the Consulting Rooms,
61 East Tenth Street, New York.

2. Dr. Kahn's fee for consultation is $5.

3. Dr. Kahn maybe consulted by letter; and
patients at a distance are requested to be as
minute as possible in describing the symptoms
of their cases, age, habits, occupation, etc.,
and if any treatment has been previously
adopted. Much of Dr. Kahn's practice is
carried on by correspondence, and he has been
successful in curing numerous cases which have
been conducted by letter only. All letters
must contain the consultation fee.



192



NERVOUS EXHAUSTION.



4. Dr. Kahn hasinadc arrangements by wliich
the necessary remedies can be forwarded, safely
packed and free from observation, to all parts
of the Avorld ; and. it is his invariable custom to
destroy all correspondence, or to return it to the
patient at the termination of each case. Pa-
tients may have letters and packages forwarded
by initials. The disclosures of a name is
neither sought nor necessary ; the most perfect
confidence may be relied on, so that no difti-
dence or timidity may prevent the application
for professional relief. Patients are, however,
requested to retain the same name or initials
throughout the case, in order to prevent con-
fusion.

5. I)r. Kahn wishes to impress the impor-
tance of one personal interview, even with pa-
tients resident at a distance, more especially
when it is necessary to make a microscopic or
chemical analysis of the urine. In fact, this is
of such importance that it would be advisable
for those consulting him by letter to forward a
small bottle per rail, carefully packed to prevent
breakage (carriage paid), containing the urine
passed in the morning.
